       "  'answer': \"Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue.  Soak the area, and wipe it away.  It might take repeated applications, but you can remove the sticker without scratching, and without leaving a gooey residue.Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces, including some plastics, so you should be careful, especially if it is clear plastic.  I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases, so it will certainly work on many plastics, but you should be careful. In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky, you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape.  Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly.  Pull the tape off sharply, and some of the residue will come with it.  This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small, however, I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective.\",\n",

       "  'answer': '1. Inspect the black rubber cover that fits in the disposal. Sometimes bits of garbage collect under the flaps and create a smell.    2. Clean the rubber cover, if necessary. If yours lifts out, remove it and clean away debris with a scrub brush and warm, soapy water. If your rubber cover is installed permanently, lift up each flap and clean it with soapy water and an old toothbrush.    3. Deodorize the disposal. Cut a lemon in half and drop the fruit and a handful of baking soda into the disposal. Turn on the cold water faucet and then the disposal. The unit will clean itself as it grinds up the mixture.',\n",
