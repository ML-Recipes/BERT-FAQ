Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects. For that reason, it is critical to wash your hands often, including utensils. Currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person in some communities in the U.S. The CDC recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. Anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow safe food handling procedures, such as washing hands and surfaces often.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. As COVID-19 spreads person-to-person in close contact, we want to reduce the chance of infection amongst populations that are vulnerable. This includes older adults (over the age of 65) and those with suppressed immune systems. It is also to help reduce the burden on healthcar esystems and workers, as there are not enough workers and beds to care for patients if everyone were to have COVID-19 at the same time.',\n",

What it means is to stay at home as much as possible, and limit your outside exposure. This does mean meaking changes to your everyday routine to minimize contacts with others, including:   avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 6 feet) from others  For example - if you need to go grocery shopping, limit to once a week. If you go on walks, make sure you maintain a 6 foot distance between yourself and others.',\n",
