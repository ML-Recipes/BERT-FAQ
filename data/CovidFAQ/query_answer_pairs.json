Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects. For that reason, it is critical to wash your hands often, including utensils. Currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person in some communities in the U.S. The CDC recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. Anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow safe food handling procedures, such as washing hands and surfaces often.",

        "answer": "Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. As COVID-19 spreads person-to-person in close contact, we want to reduce the chance of infection amongst populations that are vulnerable. This includes older adults (over the age of 65) and those with suppressed immune systems. It is also to help reduce the burden on healthcar esystems and workers, as there are not enough workers and beds to care for patients if everyone were to have COVID-19 at the same time.",

What it means is to stay at home as much as possible, and limit your outside exposure. This does mean meaking changes to your everyday routine to minimize contacts with others, including:   avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 6 feet) from others  For example - if you need to go grocery shopping, limit to once a week.

        "answer": "Face masks, including fabric ones, are only really helpful in preventing people who have coronavirus (COVID19) from spreading it to others. If the person is healthy, there is likely no need for them to wear a mask - as there is little evidence showing that these masks used by healthy people will prevent transmission to the public.  What masks can be useful in for the general public is reducing the amount of times a person touches their face, which means less opportunity for COVID19 to enter their body. This is because the mask is covering a significant amount of a person's face (namely the mouth and nose). This is the most effective practice when used in combination with frequent hand-washing with soap and water, or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  However, these is a shortage of available face masks for health workers - which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic.   [[Would you like more information?]] There are currently not enough face masks for health workers to use, which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic. This ranges from basic surgical masks to respirator masks. Health workers are also being asked to reuse them. This situation makes health workers vulnerable to becoming infected with COVID-19. If you have a surplus of face masks, it is currently recommended to donate that to your local healthcare facility. There have also been call to actions for individuals to create fabric face masks, which can be reusable, to donate to local healthcare facilities. ",

COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called \"community spread\".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

        "answer": "There is currently no evidence to suggest that this virus is circulating in animals in Canada.  It is possible that some types of animals can be infected with COVID-19 but there is no evidence that pets or other animals can spread the virus. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and this is an area that remains to be studied and understood.  Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere. However, livestock producers should follow normal biosecurity measures as always. This includes limiting visitors or workers who may have travelled to, or been in contact with, someone from an affected area.",

It is recommended that individuals who travel to avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and wet (live animal) markets.  If you are considering travel, check the latest travel health notices for the most up-to-date travel advice prior to travelling.  Importers, rescue organizations and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area: they should be closely monitored for signs of illness, you should contact a veterinarian if they become sick, and call ahead to ensure they are aware of the circumstances",

Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Cover cough and sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

It is possible that some types of animals can be infected with COVID-19 but there is no evidence that pets or other animals can spread the virus. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and this is an area that remains to be studied and understood.  Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere. However, livestock producers should follow normal biosecurity measures as always. This includes limiting visitors or workers who may have travelled to, or been in contact with, someone from an affected area.",

Respiratory droplets may also be passed from person-to-person through commonly used surfaces such as door nobs, elevator buttons and bathroom faucets.  [[Would you like more information?]] Among viruses, some are more contagious than others; for example, measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people of ALL ages around them will also become infected if they are not protected. COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called \"community spread\".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through.

COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called \"community spread\".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

What it means is to stay at home as much as possible, and limit your outside exposure. This does mean meaking changes to your everyday routine to minimize contacts with others, including:   avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 6 feet) from others  For example - if you need to go grocery shopping, limit to once a week.

        "answer": "There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.",

COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

What it means is to stay at home as much as possible, and limit your outside exposure. This does mean meaking changes to your everyday routine to minimize contacts with others, including:   avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 6 feet) from others  For example - if you need to go grocery shopping, limit to once a week.

COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Cover cough and sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through.

COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called \"community spread\".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

        "answer": "Right now, our current understanding of how COVID-19 spreads is person-to-person through respiratory droplets. We have not seen anything related to spread through food. For the surfaces of frozen foods and other food product packaging - because of the poor survivalbility of the coronaviruses on these surfaces, it is a very low risk of spread. However, it is important to make sure you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to practice general food safety. Please also continue to wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.",

What it means is to stay at home as much as possible, and limit your outside exposure. This does mean meaking changes to your everyday routine to minimize contacts with others, including:   avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 6 feet) from others  For example - if you need to go grocery shopping, limit to once a week. If you go on walks, make sure you maintain a 6 foot distance between yourself and others.",

        "answer": "The best way to prevent illness from COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to the virus and use good hand hygiene. Common sense precautions that prevent the spread of flu will also help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Please do the following: Stay home if you are sick. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Cover cough and sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should only be worn by persons who are sick or persons caring for them. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and hard surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.",

COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called \"community spread\".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

For the surfaces of frozen foods and other food product packaging - because of the poor survivalbility of the coronaviruses on these surfaces, it is a very low risk of spread. However, it is important to make sure you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to practice general food safety. Please also continue to wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.",

        "answer": "A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%). ",

COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called \"community spread\".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

        "answer": "There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.",

COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere.

It is possible that some types of animals can be infected with COVID-19 but there is no evidence that pets or other animals can spread the virus. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and this is an area that remains to be studied and understood.  Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere. However, livestock producers should follow normal biosecurity measures as always. This includes limiting visitors or workers who may have travelled to, or been in contact with, someone from an affected area.",

COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

It is possible that some types of animals can be infected with COVID-19 but there is no evidence that pets or other animals can spread the virus. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and this is an area that remains to be studied and understood.  Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere. However, livestock producers should follow normal biosecurity measures as always.

COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.",

        "answer": "There is currently no evidence to suggest that this virus is circulating in animals in Canada.  It is possible that some types of animals can be infected with COVID-19 but there is no evidence that pets or other animals can spread the virus. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and this is an area that remains to be studied and understood.  Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere. However, livestock producers should follow normal biosecurity measures as always. This includes limiting visitors or workers who may have travelled to, or been in contact with, someone from an affected area.",

At this time, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19.  It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses and take the appropriate steps to avoid and prevent infection. Proper hygiene can help reduce the risk of getting an infection or spreading infection to others.  If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.",

If these droplets from an infected person reach another person through the nose, eyes, or mouth it can transmit the disease. It isn't airborne in the same way measles is, but it does linger in the air for some amount of time. However, we are still not sure how long it is in the air for, when the virus particles will rest on the ground or surrounding surfaces, and how it helps transmit to other people.",

        "answer": "A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%). ",

        "answer": "COVID-19 is being spread through respiratory droplets that come from coughing or sneezing. If these droplets from an infected person reach another person through the nose, eyes, or mouth it can transmit the disease. It isn't airborne in the same way measles is, but it does linger in the air for some amount of time. However, we are still not sure how long it is in the air for, when the virus particles will rest on the ground or surrounding surfaces, and how it helps transmit to other people.",

        "answer": "There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.",

        "question": "what has caused this coronavirus",
        "answer": "There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.",

[[Would you like more information?]] Among viruses, some are more contagious than others; for example, measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people of ALL ages around them will also become infected if they are not protected. COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called \"community spread\".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

[[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

[[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",

Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Cover cough and sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called \"community spread\".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",
