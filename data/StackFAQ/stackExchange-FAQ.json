                    "IMPORTRANGE() appears to be the function you want.  From the Google spreadsheets function list :   Google Spreadsheets lets you reference   another workbook in the spreadsheet   that you're currently editing by using   the ImportRange function. ImportRange   lets you pull one or more cell values   from one spreadsheet into another. To   create your own ImportRange formulas,   enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,   range). For languages where comma is   used for decimal separation, use a   semicolon instead of a comma to   separate arguments in your formula.  Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is   the key value from the spreadsheet   URL.  Range is a STRING representing the   range of cells you want to import,   optionally including the sheet name   (defaults to first sheet). You can   also use a range name if you prefer.  Given that the two arguments are   STRINGs, you need to enclose them in   quotes or refer to cells which have   string values in them.  For example:  =importrange(\"abcd123abcd123\", \"sheet1!A1:C10\") \"abcd123abcd123\" is   the value in the \"key=\" attribute on   the URL of the target spreadsheet and   \"sheet1!A1:C10\" is the range which is   desired to be imported.  =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1   contains sheet1!A1:C10  Note: In order to use ImportRange, you   need to have been added as a viewer or   collaborator to the spreadsheet from   which ImportRange is pulling the data.   Otherwise, you'll get this error:   \"#REF! error: The requested   spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell   range was not found.\"   \"key\" is of course the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter.  I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first I put a string. In cell A1 of the second I put =importRange(\"tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A\",\"A1\") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.)  (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to be replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange(\"tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A\";\"A1\") )  NOTES:   Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 \"cross-workbook reference formulas\" per spreadsheet. Source: Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides size limits . (h/t JJ Rohrer )  The \"new\" Google Spreadsheet (soon to be the standard) removes the 50 limit of 50 \"cross-workbook reference formulas ( Google Support ) (h/t Jacob Jan Tuinstra )   In the \"new\" Google Sheets you also use the entire URL as the key ( Google Support ) (h/t Punchlinern )",

You can access these elements with Google Apps Script, a variant of Javascript - but writing Markdown from the elements isn't as straightforward as you'd think (you have to essentially implement a markdown parser in Apps Script).  When I came to do this earlier in the year there were dozens of forks of Renato Mangini's \" gdocs2md \" repo, but he seemed to have stopped fielding pull requests, and over the period of a few years forks had appeared that were far better than others. I went through many of these in the tree and put the best into a new package, which also generates HTML mixed with the markdown for elements Google Docs supports such as superscript and subscript elements (which markdown has no way of representing). Even incorporating the best of others' edits, the parsing needed work, and I'm confident that this is the best available for the job at present.  Script available on GitHub with installation instructions:  lmmx/gdocs2md-html  I also worked on adding in the most important feature to such a script - user features - providing the markdown in a pop-up within Google Docs rather than saving to file (I think the original was batch saving for entire folders, which is not suitable for my document-drafting needs, or how I use Google Docs at all).    I'd like to suggest it be a single more sophisticated project for interested developers to collaborate on (or at least suggest features for) rather than everyone forking off scripts of various quality, when we're likely working to the same aims.  As well as reducing duplication of effort, the Google Docs policy for creation of \"add-ons\" states that to be published (and therefore 'installable' rather than needing to be loaded for each document in a slightly awkward manner)    The add-on must be fully functional \u2014 it can't be a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d  The script has been tested with multiple active users.    Obviously if you wanted a \"pure\" markdown then either switch off these features (the code is there to fork) or just don't use sub/superscripts, etc. It wouldn't be too difficult to add personalised settings to such a script if it matures as an add-on, if there's significant interest.",

                    "Updated: There is a blog today about updated Gmail search modifiers that allow you to do this with a simple search!  has:nouserlabels  Note: Because of Gmails threading you will have labels on some of the messages in the derived list because some messages in a thread will have labeling while some won't. (From Gmail Help - Advanced Search site .)  Original answer:  The Gmail advanced search help page says:   label: Search for messages by label*  There isn't a search operator for unlabeled messages  Example: from:amy label:friends Meaning: Messages from Amy that have the label \"friends\"  Example: from:david label:my-family Meaning: Messages from David that have the label \"My Family\"",
                    "One way you can do it is by using the minus operator on the label operator. So for example:  -label:tag-a -label:tag-b -label:tag-c  or for one-word tags:  -label:{taga tagb tagc}  This is probably only practical if you don't have a lot of labels.  Additionally, if they don't change often, you can include a link to this search so that it easily accessible from Gmail. There is a Google Labs product which puts a box of links on the left side and allows you to customize them. Just add a link to this search query and you'll be able to access your untagged messages easily.  It seems like there is a greasemonkey script which will work too. Here is the script's website . It creates a special label, Unlabelled , to search for all the conversations without a real label.",
                    "Google has the operator has:nouserlabels now. It works like a charm for what you want to do.  I don't know why it was so difficult to find for so long. Maybe it is fairly new.",
                    "In my case I had lots of rubbish in the All Mail folder, mail that should have been deleted but accumulated there for some reason. I wanted to get rid of it without touching anything that was labelled including the nonuser labels. This did the trick:  has:nouserlabels -in:Inbox -in:Draft -in:Sent",
                    "I would try:  has:nouserlabels -in:trash -is:chat -in:inbox",
                    "This works very well, except in my experience, it only shows 20 per page, no matter what your settings are, and won't show the total number to fix, but still... got the job done! Put this in your inbox search box:  in:inbox has:nouserlabels"

So thanks for reminding me to make it.  And thanks to @Lipis for the Unicode char idea.  Here's an example of the output:  +------+--------+--------+ |      | ColA   | ColB   | +------+--------+--------+ | Row1 | CellA1 | CellB1 | | Row2 | CellA2 | CellB2 | | Row3 | CellA3 | CellB3 | +------+--------+--------+",

I found it quite useful to get unicode tables (which I sometimes prefer over the Windows-1252 compatible \"ASCII\" art). And this tool lets you compare the outputs, as well as getting a HTML formatted table, too.  Example to show my workflow: I'm making a web app for my bookkeeper to calculate sales tax and I am doing math on months and quarters so that the tool always automatically displays \"last quarter's sales tax info\" . Since  I'm always thinking of arrays starting with 0, I needed to embed a simple table outlining the months in each quarter to keep the values sorted in my head.  1) To get the table started, I used this generator (listed on both this and the other QA) with its Excel-like input interface to actually create the data, as the unicode tool wants pre-formatted text. I type in the values then select them and CTRL-C to get my tab delimited table:  Quarter Numbers Names Q1  1, 2, 3 Jan, Feb, Mar Q2  4, 5, 6 Apr, May, Jun Q3  7, 8, 9 Jul, Aug, Sep Q4  10, 11, 12  Oct, Nov, Dec  2) went to senseful's generator and pasted into the input area.

                    "I wrote a bookmarklet to help with this task.  It's very crude and it works for me today, but I've only tested it briefly and only in Chrome.  It calls some JavaScript functions in Trello directly so it's extremely likely that it will break when they update the site.  Hopefully it works for you, but please don't use it if your data is critical in case it mangles it.  If you want to try it out, you can get the code from here .  There's both a readable version, and a version suitable for copying into a bookmarklet.  To use:   Go here , select the entire contents (\"javascript:...\" to \"...%29%28%29%3B\") and copy to the clipboard.  Create a new bookmark, call it something like \"Trello - Add Many\" and paste the contents from step 1 into the URL field for the bookmark.  Go to the Trello board you want to add items to and click the bookmark.  An overlay should appear that will let you select the list you want to add cards to, and enter a number of new card titles -- one per line.  The overlay will disappear when you hit \"Submit\".  If you want to get rid of the overlay without adding any new cards then just refresh the page.   Note: If you're trying to get your tasks out of Google Tasks and into Trello then choose Actions - Print task list in Google Tasks, copy the tasks from the printable view, and paste into the bookmarklet's entry box.",
                    "This facility is now built in to Trello.   Copy all your notes, one-per-line, to the clipboard  In a list in a Trello board, click on \"Add\"  Paste in all your lines, to this first new item  Click Add, or hit Enter, and Trello will create one new task per row,",
                    "Most of the solutions I saw here were pretty technical. Here is one that is really easy to do. You could use this Zap to automatically create Trello Cards from Google Docs spreadsheet rows .   The idea is that once you make this Zap, you can paste your CSV into the a Google Doc and run it through into Trello.  I think there is a limit of about 200 items per 10 minutes when importing stuff across, but normally you won't hit that.",

                    "If you are talking about searching, then @akira's question is correct. However, it sounds like you are asking about how to use this condition in a filter.  The trick is that you can put whatever search criteria you want in the filter's Has the words field. For any other field it will prefix your criteria with the field name. For example, if you type user@example.com in the To field, it'll create the filter condition to:(user@example.com) . The reason it works in the Has the words field, is because it doesn't prefix it with anything. This is because it acts as a normal search on the content of the email.   Create or modify a filter.  In the Has the words field, enter your OR condition. For example: to:user@example.com OR from:user@example.com   This is also the place to put any other attributes you want to match (e.g. label: , in: , etc.).  This will also work in the Show search options page, however it's easier to just use a normal search instead.",
                    "To my surprise, the solution to me was using the vertical bar | between emails instead of the comma , in the TO filed during filter creation.

                    "From today (2016-05-20) on, Google is starting to roll out the ability to embed a chart from a Google spreadsheet into a Google document. At this point, two of my 3 Google accounts make the option available in the Insert menu, with a new Insert\u2192Chart submenu below the Insert\u2192Drawing\u2026 item.  When you insert such charts, they remain linked to the original spreadsheet. If all you want is tabular data, there's a table chart type that you can use to present your data as a simple table.  There are some limitations at this stage (e.g. regarding the size of the chart) and the chart must pre-exist in the spreadsheet before you can insert it, but this is going in the right direction\u2026  The chart is not updated live if you modify the source spreadsheet while your document is opened, however, the document will detect changes and offer you to update your chart to reflect the latest changes in the source.",
                    "AFAIK, you can only copy and paste from the spreadsheet to the text document. The spreadsheet is inserted as a table, but they are not linked: if you change something in the Spreadsheet, it will not get reflected in the text document.  Of course, I'd absolutely love to be proved wrong!",
                    "Here is a script-based solution which allows one to insert a table with the contents from a given range within a given spreadsheet. I did not try to find a way to sync data real-time, as it didn't seem practical given potentially large volume of data that would have to be transferred with every edit to the spreadsheet. Instead, the script adds a custom menu item \"update data\" to the document.  The script should be bound to the document (i.e., created using Tools > Script Editor in the document menu). The spreadsheet URL, as well as the sheet and range to use, are specified within the script. To embed all the data on the sheet, replace .getRange(rangeName) with .getDataRange() .  When the function updateData is first executed, it appends the table at the end of document. At subsequent runs, it updates the table in place (i.e., if  more text is added after the table, the order will be preserved).  Note that cutting-pasting the table would break the updating process (the script would add a new table at the end) since the pasted copy is a new object. Instead, cut-paste the text around the table.  function onOpen() {   DocumentApp.getUi()              .createMenu('Custom')              .addItem('Update Data', 'updateData')              .addToUi(); }  function updateData() {   var ssUrl = ' spreadsheet url here ';   var sheetName = 'Sheet2';   // name of sheet to use   var rangeName = 'A1:C3';    // range of values to include     var values = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(ssUrl)                              .getSheetByName(sheetName)                              .getRange(rangeName)                              .getValues();   var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();   var body = doc.getBody();   var ranges = doc.getNamedRanges('embeddedSheet-range');   if (ranges.length == 0) {     var table = body.appendTable(values);   }   else {     tableRange = ranges[0];     table = tableRange.getRange().getRangeElements()[0].getElement();     var ind = body.getChildIndex(table);     tableRange.remove();     body.removeChild(table);     table = body.insertTable(ind, values);   }   var rangeBuilder = doc.newRange();   rangeBuilder.addElement(table);   doc.addNamedRange('embeddedSheet-range', rangeBuilder.build()); }  Technical notes   It's also possible to sync the data every hour, in addition to manually. Just add a time-based trigger from Script Editor's Resources menu, so that it runs the function updateData.  One can also adapt this script to be bound to the source spreadsheet instead. This would require changes in how the document is opened (e.g., by URL), but otherwise the logic is the same.  The cumbersome part of the script is getting the handle of the existing table in the document. This requires placing it within a Named Range. Also, it is much more expedient to completely replace the table element than to mess with the entries of an existing table. Since a Named Range is immutable, it is also removed with the table it contains, and then created again, along with the new table.",

There are usually good chances, he may have pushed one   of his own commits.

With the spreadsheet open, click the Tools menu, then Script editor... . Paste all this code into the editor:  function onOpen(event) {   var ss = event.source;   var menuEntries = [];   menuEntries.push({name: \"Go to sheet...\", functionName: \"showGoToSheet\"});   ss.addMenu(\"Tasks\", menuEntries); }  function showGoToSheet() {   var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();   var allsheets = ss.getSheets();   var app = UiApp.createApplication();   app.setTitle(\"Go to sheet...\").setWidth(800).setHeight(600);   var table = app.createFlexTable();   table.setCellPadding(5).setCellSpacing(0);   var goToSheetClick = app.createServerHandler('handleGoToSheetClick');   var widgets = [];   for (var i = 0; i < allsheets.length; i++) {     var sheet_name = allsheets[i].getName();     widgets[i] = app.createHTML(sheet_name).setId(sheet_name).addClickHandler(goToSheetClick);     table.setWidget(i, 1, widgets[i])   }   var panel = app.createSimplePanel();   panel.add(table);   app.add(panel);   ss.show(app); }  function handleGoToSheetClick(e) {   var sheet_name = e.parameter.source;   var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();   var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(sheet_name);   sheet.activate();   var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication();   app.close();   return app; }  Save the script, then refresh the spreadsheet. After a second or two a new menu, Tasks , will appear after Help . There is one item in this menu: Go to sheet...   This menu item will open a panel with a list of names of all the sheets in the current spreadsheet. It doesn't look like it, but if you click on one of the sheet names, that sheet will come to the front.

                    "The best way to do this from my experience is to tie a function to a button/image. The only drawback is that you cannot pass parameters along with a script assigned to a button. Due to this you will need to make a function specific to each navigation but they can call be a in a single script file.  Steps:  Create an image (Insert -> image) and style it to your preference  Create a custom function with the following:  function showSheetByName(Name) {    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();    var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(Name);    SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(sheet); }  and then a function specific to your button  function showSheet5() {    showSheetByName(\"Sheet5\"); }  Finally assign this function to your button  Assign Script... showSheet5  You should now be able to click on your button and navigate to \"Sheet5\".

After trying different queries for an hour, I realised multiple queries would do the trick. And this worked for me.  1. Search for   in:inbox to:me category:personal   Select all conversations that match this search, and Label as: Create new Label \u2192 Replied  2. Search for   in:inbox from:me -label:replied   Select all conversations that match this search, and Label as: Create new Label \u2192 NoReplyPlusChats  3. Search for   label:NoReplyPlusChats is:chats   Select all conversations that match this search, and Remove Label NoReplyPlusChats \u2192 Apply  4. Rename Label NoReplyPlusChats to NoReply  5.

                    "None of the previous answers worked for me. Searching for -subject:re and equivalents seem to match EVERY conversation. I believe this is because that search is positive for the first message in the conversation (which does not have \"Re:\" in the subject line).  What works for me is:   Create a label (I called it \"HasReply\") using the filter: subject:(+re)  Then search for -label:hasreply or -label:hasreply -from:me   The logic here is that the first search will find all of the conversations with a reply. The second will then exclude those - leaving the messages without replies.  Adding the -from:me addresses a corner case where I'm searching a bunch of emails, sent NOT from me, to multiple recipients, and I want to find the ones NOBODY has replied to. Without the -from:me the results will for some reason include conversations where I am the only person who has replied. Adding this would not be appropriate in answering the original question, where the person wanted to find emails he had sent (which this would exclude) and had not received a reply to.  Alas, it is still not perfect. I create and apply the filter (\"to matching conversations\") and all is good. Then new replies come in and they don't seem to be added to the label...so I have to go back in like I'm editing the filter and re-apply it to catch the latest messages.",

I discovered this slightly more friendly hack after noticing the URL of the inbox: unread first . After expanding the unread section, you'll notice in the location bar there's a #section_query . With the exception of that one part, it's practically the same as a search result URL.  So, the solution is to first input the search terms and search. Then, in the address bar, replace #search with #section_query .  This will provide you with a search page with the same amount of pages as specified in your settings, without the hassle of creating a filter.",

Now you get as many lines as your gmail 'Maximum page size' settings  allow (100 in my case).

Edit : Preserving labels should work fine, but not quite in the way that Gmail handles them. I've not seen any IMAP or POP3 servers which handle the Gmail label system properly. Gmail presents each tag as a separate folder through IMAP, so as far as the user is concerned, the message exists in several places. (In fact, the inbox is just another label).

                    "Trello does not have an official way to handle dependencies. The best thing to do is to have a \"Waiting\" list where you keep all the cards that are waiting on some other piece of work. If this becomes unmanageable, it's probably a sign that the board needs to be split up.",
                    "I've been wrestling with this too. The best solution I've found at this point is a checklist item to post a note on the dependent card. Manual process but it doesn't take that long and usually there is some communications that would help \"passing the torch\".  I've found by doing it this way it provides a prompt of what to do and and an automatic notification to the person assigned to the dependent card. No need to try and \"train\" anyone.",
                    "Trello Card Dependencies Chrome Extension.  We wrote this to help solve the problem for us and then made it free.",
                    "Check out Parent/Child Management for Trello extension.  We faced the same problem for our Trello projects and have created this extension. It works great for us. Moreover, it's completely open source , so feel free to pull source code and contribute!",
                    "Trello doesn't (currently) have a way to link items directly to each other.  The approach that works for me is to use a \"waiting\" -label on items that are stuck. This way they can maintain the context that their lists provide. And since items can have multiple labels it doesn't conflict with any existing labels either.  Of course, if your lists don't contain any context worth maintaining, a separate list for waiting items works well too.  For updating the state of the dependent card, I suggest Bob Snodgrass's answer of adding a checklist item for each prerequisite card, that says \"Add note on dependent card X when complete\". Or if you need further organization, you could even create a \"Dependencies\" -checklist on the dependent card with items for each prerequisite card. Then people completing the prerequisite card can just go mark their card as done.  The best feature of Trello is how it keeps all the features simple - so that's probably why there's no dependency, since it would make things more complicate. That said, I think a feature to link items (if kept simple and clear) would be a wonderful addition, as it is a basic element of keeping work organized.",
                    "One option to address dependencies that I've started using is leveraging the convert task to card and card link functions.  This expands on Ilari Kajaste's answer.  For example:   Create the parent card  Create a task list on the parent card - these tasks will become the child cards  Convert the tasks to cards (Click on the task to enter edit mode, click \"Convert to Card\" link  A new card will be created (using the same title as the converted task), and in it's activity notes will be a link back to the parent card.  I copy this link into the description or into a new checklist task for transparency - the original link may eventually be buried under later activity notes.  To tie child back to parent, click the \"More\" link at the bottom right hand corner of the child card and copy the shortcut link from the \"Link to this Card\" field  Navigate back to the parent card via the link in the activity notes (or closing the card and navigating manually) and add the child card link in the parent description, task list or other convenient place.   The owner of the parent card can check off the dependent tasks as they are completed.  This is straight forward using the links added in the last point above. Alternatively, the owner of one of the child cards can have a final task to navigate back to the parent card and check off the initial task.  A nice feature of this process is that if these child cards are later moved to another board, the links persist.  The product owner can create the relationships on a planning board, move cards willy nilly and still have easy access to and from those cards where ever they land.  Even if the manual copying / pasting of links is not completed, there will always be at least this one artifact of the original parentage in the child card.  The downside is there is at least one manual step (copying child card link to parent card) to create a solid relationship, but overall is a good alternative to the more management heavy processes such as maintaining separate \"waiting\" lists and describing the dependent cards.",
                    "We have written a \"Links\" addon for Trello that adds JIRA-like dependencies - with various types like \"depends on\" or \"blocks\".

                    "I figured out a way to do this for Mac users using Mac Mail and address book without needing to download extra software. This works with Mac Mail 4.6 and Address Book 5.0.3. Not sure if it works for other vers or not. This may work similarly for other IMAP Email programs like Thunderbird, but I can't vouch for that.  Here are the steps:   Set up your Gmail account in Mac Mail. Make sure the incoming mail server is \"imap.gmail.com\" You can find this under the toolbar>Mail>Preferences>Accounts.  In Gmail, create a Label for the emails for which you want to extract email addresses.  In Gmail, label all the emails you want per Label above.  In Gmail, go to Settings>Labels and tick off the the box for the new Label you created that says \"Show in IMAP.\"  Restart Mac Mail so the new Gmail Label syncs.  Open Address Book. If you use Address Book for your contacts you'll need to back up your contacts because you need to delete all contacts in Address Book. I believe you can do this with File>Export>Address Book Archive. I don't use Address Book other than for exporting Gmail emails so I can't give good advice on this. Delete Address Book contacts at your own risk.  In Address Book, delete all your contacts. You should be able to do this by selecting one contact, pressing Command+a and pressing the delete key.  In Mac Mail, find your IMAP folder. There should be a column on the left side of the window with all your Mailboxes. If not go to the top toolbar, select View>Show Mailboxes or press Command+Shift+M. The IMAP folder will be toward the bottom of the column below \"Reminders\", \"RSS\", \"On My Mac\" etc. You should see the Name of your Gmail account you set up earlier with a dropdown arrow on the left.  In Mac Mail, click the dropdown arrow next to your mailbox. This will show you a list of folders and should show the Label you created in Gmail as a folder. Select this folder by clicking it.  In Mac Mail in the Messages window )which should now display all your emails for you Gmail Label), select all the emails in the list. Go to the top toolbar, select Messages>Add Senders to Address Book or press Shift+Command+Y. All the senders for your Gmail Label should now be in Address Book.  In Address Book you can now export contacts as vCards to use in whatever program you like by going to the toolbar and selecting File>Export>Export vCards.

                    "This new answer works if one of the other recipients has a top level domain that is common-ish and different from yours.  Aaron's answer appears not to work, for two reasons.  The first is that google does not implement wild cards in gmail ( Wildcard search in Gmail ). The second reason is that, from experience, I find the search considers BOTH conjuncts, to:me and, say, -to:com .  It's easy to check by entering to:me -to:com in the search bar, and finding that nothing sent to your gmail.com address is there.  From the question I linked above we know that you need to search tokens; e.g., top level domains like .com and .org. But we know we can't just do  to:me to:(-com -org -edu -gov -uk -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  As an aside, don't try and putting ALL top level domains in, as the search will be rejected for length.  I got the above list from This blog post about common TLDs .  There is one more thing to deal with, and that is the empty to: field.  My work around is to use is:important to limit the intrusion of these.  Gmail complained when I tried to make a filter with this flag, but it did properly filter a new (important) email to me.  So, we come to my answer, where my own top level domains are .com and .uk (.ac.uk, but the .uk is a token in itself):  is:important to:((-com OR me) -coop -org -edu -gov (-uk OR me) -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  This enforces the following two properties:  1. Emails to anyone with a listed domain different from yours are rejected  2. If an email has one of your domains, it must be (at least) to you.  In a similar manner, you can add specific email addresses that you commonly receive email together with you by adding something like -<coworker@yourdomain.com>"

Since it will be in another language as the video's audio track (and not in English either) you will have to prepare a time-coded subtitle script (or caption file ).

                    "Interesting.  I tested by sending an email to my Gmail acct from an Exchange account, and setting the flag urgent.  Then I looked at the email in the web interface and from Outlook. In Outlook (getting Gmail) I saw the message flagged urgent. In the Web interface, I saw no urgent indication.  I replied to the message from the web interface and from Outlook. In the web interface, the urgent flag was not shown, and did not make it back to the Exchange account. In Outlook, the reply did not have the urgent flag activated, but when I activated it it was visible back on the Exchange account.  So, to summarize .. the Gmail web interface does not recognize the urgent flag, at least not as implemented by Microsoft Exchange. But the Gmail engine does not lose the header data when it is provided by another client.  As an aside .. I find the urgent flag far more irritation than it is worth.  Rarely does \"urgent\" to you mean that it should be \"urgent\" to me. When is the last time that you received a message flagged \"low priority\"?  IMHO it is far better to indicate in the subject and body that the issue is urgent or time-sensitive.  EDIT: Google just added (1-Sept-2010) the \"Priority Inbox\" functionality and some kind of importance measure. I will redo my tests and update.",

Go to:  Video Manager >> Edit (on the video you want) >> Captions >> (Click on the track you want to download) >> Actions (drop down box)  At the time of writing, there are three file types available:   .vtt  .srt  .sbv   These have different uses in different applications, but are very similar. SRT is probably the most common.  Otherwise, if it is not your video, the best method (only method) is to get the xml file from the Developer tools.  Using Google Chrome in this example, navigate to the video then follow these steps:   Pause the video. Wait for it to play if there is an advertisement.  Push F12 on your keyboard. This opens the developer tools. You may have to click on some empty space in the page so that the video is not active.  Click on the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Click the transcript icon just below the video. Two items will come up in the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Both items are titled timedtext? plus a bunch of variables. The second one is typically the one you want. It starts like this:  <transcript>      <text start=\"4.14\" dur=\"3.049\">my name is doctor john rush</text>      <text start=\"7.189\" dur=\"3.731\">I'm the CEO and president</text>   This xml file is useful if you want to use the transcript in a web page. Other than that, I don't think you can use it the same way you would use an SRT file. If you are any good at programming, you can easily write up a program that will convert it to SRT. I wrote my own C# program that extracts the data for a different purpose and it took less than two hours."

There are however browser extensions and apps that let you schedule new emails or replies:   Streak is a free browser extension CRM for Gmail and has a \"Send later\" feature (you don't need to bother with the CRM at all). You can conveniently schedule a reply right from the Compose box. I've been using it for about a year and it works very well, except that if I change the Subject line, the message won't go through. You need to go in Drafts and Send it Later from there again, under the new Subject line. Works for Google Apps accounts, as well as Gmail. Best choice.  RightInbox is free for up to 10 emails per month, and supports email tracking via an embedded image (web bug). I've used it in its early stage while it was very buggy and corresponded with its author. You can schedule replies right from the Compose window.  Boomergang is free for up to 10 emails per month. After that, it's $5/mo for Gmail accounts and $15 for Google Apps accounts.  Gmail Delay Send is a script you have to install via Google Docs. I tried it; the process was somewhat convoluted and the tool is rough and immature. It is however fully free and open source, and won't add any additional load to your browser (unlike extensions). This is the most promising and most lightweight solution . Unfortunately, it has seen no development since May 2012 .  Momento Mail is a Google App (not a browser extension), and you have to use their own website. As of November 2013, it no longer works (directs to a blank page after typing in the scheduling and recipient info). To schedule a reply, you'd have to copy/paste the To, CC and email body from Gmail. Quite cumbersome. Their \"To\" field doesn't support the standard address format Name <address@company.com> . The message won't end up in your Gmail Sent folder, but you have an option to BCC yourself. Least recommended.",

                    "What you are wanting to do is not possible.  Quote from YouTube Help ( Replace old video with a new one ):   There is currently no way to replace an old video with a new one and retain the original view count, comments or ratings. You'll have to start over with your newer video.",
                    "It should't be possible and I hope it's not. The reason is simple: Let's say you are uploading one really interesting video that goes viral with few millions views and then you are changing it to something completely boring. Wouldn't it be a little bit confusing for the new viewers on why exactly this video got so many views?  I think you can make few tweaks to the video from what YouTube offers you and maybe the editor could help, but I'm not a YouTuber to know anything more.",
                    "In my opinion, probably the issue is not that YouTube would or would not allow video replacement but it\u2019s the original content that can't be altered. By allowing such ability, it would contaminate the authenticity of original content."

                    "Facebook has access to all friendship-data on their site, even if you lock down the privacy settings. As an addition many users share their contact-book or even e-mails with Facebook. Most peoples have filled out their profile quite decent so it has data about your school, your employer, your current place, your interests and so on. Although Facebook states it does not use it, they can track all users (and even non-users) across many websites via the \"like\"-button which is transcluded directly from Facebook.  From this data it can calculate this friend requests.",
                    "I just created a new Facebook profile. I used a dummy email address to create the page.  Facebook then starts suggesting - GUESS WHO - myself, my gf, my sister and my closest friends as \"people I might know\".  Consequently, Facebook must go much deeper than just look at your friends and whose profile you are looking at - they seem to have monitored my IP address and connected the new Facebook profile to my old profile. Then they suggested myself and my friends.",
                    "Even though your security settings are \"locked down\", Facebook still can use your friends list to find other people you may know. Other people may not be able to find you but Facebook can and will still use your information (such as your friend list). They cross reference your list of friends to your friends' friend list to find people you may know. There is probably some kind of complex algorithm behind who exactly they suggest. The algorithm probably checks for multiple friends in common, current location (for distance), similar groups, similar schools, employers, etc.",
                    "I suspect that \"stalking\" and similar activities might also have an impact.  In other words, if a person A repeatedly visits the public profile of another person B, then Facebook might deduce and suggest to B (and maybe even to established friends of B) that A is a friend."

Something that gives recipients a unique one-click URL to specify their free time: also unsure of this; the only way of finding out would be to create an account and try it.

Rather than tediously entering each address in the address book, go directly to \"Create a meeting request\".  Propose one or more dates and times.  On the next \"Meeting Event Details\" screen, paste your list of email addresses, one address per line or separate with a  comma, to a maximum of 50.  Select the \"Add all new addresses to Address Book\" box, to eliminate entering the addresses the next time.  I recently implemented this for a local community band.  Many of the musicians are not comfortable using computers, so the two click response without the need for a login was excellent.  The response rate 75%+ greatly exceeded what we were getting with just email.   It has lots of features which came in handy eg reminders to non-responders, adding additional details, printing lists of people attending etc.  The price is great; free.

Time selection is easily clickable/draggable, reporting is intuitive and visual, and there's minimal setup involved (read: practically none).  There is no contact list integration, but you can send the short, private link directly to your recipients.  And, of course, it's free!  The only criterion listed above which I'd say it falls a bit short on is the ability for the organizer to specify time intervals that are \"on the table\".  You can specify a list of dates, and a range of times on those dates, but that range must be contiguous and the same across dates.  In effect, the organizer doesn't get special priority in limiting the choices.  Although it wasn't one of your criteria, it also lacks time zone support, so it's really only good for face-to-face or highly localized meetings."

                    "The IMAP interface to Gmail now provides access to chat messages . If you had already set up Gmail IMAP, then you only have to enable the IMAP visibility for the \"Chat\" label in the Gmail settings (in the \"Label\" tab, a \"show in IMAP\" tick box is available for each label).  Update : this method works for Google Chat, but NOT for Hangouts, only conversations of the type Google Chat are exposed via IMAP, roughly all conversations until Spring/Summer 2013, depending on when one has enabled Google Hangouts.  Sources:   GMvault/chats no longer being saved  Gmail Migration/Can we download Google Hangouts history   The latter link provides an alternative to download via Google Takeout in the JSON format",
                    "Forward them to an email address you have POP/IMAP access to.",
                    "There is no explicit way of exporting your Google Chat logs through a Google provided function but there are a number of different alternative methods which seem to be available.   The first, as mentioned by Simon, is to forward them to an email address where you can download them via POP/IMAP.  You can install the \"Create a Document\" labs experiment for Google Mail which allows you to create a document for each chat. This could be quite laborious though and then you have to backup from Google Docs, which is another step.  There appears to be a python script here which backups Google Chat logs. However, in the comments there appears to be some issues with being temporarily locked out if you download too much at once.",
                    "Have a look \"How to do that\", without use of any software http://digivorous.blogspot.com/2010/11/how-to-download-and-backup-your.html",
                    "You could make a filter in GMail to do the heavy lifting for you.  When making a new filter, put \"in:chats\" in the \"Has the words:\" blank, and then choose the action you want to take (such as forwarding).  By the way, it's useful to note that the \"Has the words:\" blank functions just like the search bar above (as far as I can tell), so you can enter all kinds of search operators in there to make really complex filters!",
                    "none of the forwarding labelling filtering solutions work...  \"no old mail will be forwarded\"   it appears that option 3 is the only solution that may work - but even that has the risk of being locked out for 24 hours - or whatever.   AMAZING! - Why is it that we cannot access the chat logs? is there some legal issue? I have searched for this on many occasion and always give up.  There isn't a clear answer that I can find anywhere and all the supposed answers come up short... and last time I tried, I could not get the Python script to work - but then I was on x64, and not very familiar with Python in the first place.  I am about to try again - crossing my fingers.",
                    "I have figured out a way to get them out via forwarding them, using a browser scripting tool call iMacros.  I think this macro will only work with Firefox 3.6 which you can get from this link .  I wont go into installing and setting either of them up, but here is the macro I used.  VERSION BUILD=7300701 RECORDER=FX TAB T=1 FRAME F=4 TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:hE&&TXT:Reply WAIT SECONDS=.5 TAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=NAME:NoFormName ATTR=NAME:to CONTENT=test@GMAIL.COM TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TABINDEX:1&&ROLE:button&&TXT:Send WAIT SECONDS=3 TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ALT:&&SRC:images/cleardot.gif&&CLASS:iHkD0e&&TXT: WAIT SECONDS=2  Just replace 'test@gmail.com' with the email address you want to forward to.  Now the only other key piece of advice is where to start the loop of the macro.  To do it right, you will want to create a label and assign all your gmail chats to it.  This will allow you to see your chats in chronological order and forward them that way.  Then in gmail click on the label, when the list opens it will likely open to the newest first.  Therefore, go the the last page of the labels contents.  Open the last item.  here is when you click \"play loop\" in iMacros.  I had 1k chats to export.  You'll notice there are \"wait\" statements in the code, this will give the browser time to keep up. They may need tweaking.  Also, check back every couple of minutes, because it sometimes throws an error, or tries to move to the next (newer) chat before the email has been sent.  Just click \"cancel\" and it will go back to the script and the email will have been sent.  If it throws any other errors during operation, you should be able to adjust the loop duration and start it again with no problems.  This has been aggravating me for so long since I switched Gmail accounts due to spam, so I am finally happy to close that account having got all my content out."

Whenever I search for a friend on facebook, I start to type the person's name, and after the first few letters, I get a list of people who's first or last name starts with the letters I've typed.  NORMALLY, the list of friends starts with people I'm already friends with, and leads into people who I might possibly know through mutual friends.  BUT...  I've recently started dating a guy.  Now, when I type in the letter \"G\" to search my friend Georgia, the first person on my list is my boyfriend's best friend who's last name begins with \"G\".  Then I tried \"K\" for Kelly.  Instead of seeing my friend Kelly who would normally appear, I get a list of people with the last name Keats - my boyfriend's sisters, mother, aunt, and cousins.  I haven't visited any of these profiles before, so I'm guessing that they're all checking out mine to see what the new girl is all about.  That just goes to show that the search results are based, at least in part, on profile visits.",

                    "I feel it has to do with who views your page, for how long, who you view, for how long,  and how frequently you search them. Your friends probably has a somewhat large value to show up first and/or their friends and the value can probably be lowered than a non-friend due to the time factor spent on a non-friend's page. Maybe even clicks is played into the search. There is a complicated formula. Facebook is crazy about this stuff. In the movie, when Mark (facebook CEO) did the site about which girl at school was hot or not, he ask a friend to come up with a formula to determine a winner. With how brilliant facebook has become, I don't doubt for a second that they take into consideration all these factors and 20,000 others when designing this formula.  I liked this guy and I couldn't find his page. Of course he was searching me as well and I'm assuming the reason why I was unable to search him was because he made his page only searchable to friends. (he has a girlfriend that's why and didn't want me to know) When he did allow me to search him, he was the first one after I typed his name. I didn't see this before.",

It looks first for any of your friends names that start with a v.  If it finds a friend it then displays it.  I've noticed that if you have a friends page that you visit more often.  If you then start typing the first letter it shows that as a first result.  So it seems they save your frequently searched allowing them to give you better results.",
                    "I can definitely say that there are people who have come up on that list who are not my Facebook friends, and who I have never looked up, and I recognize them from my past. Also, I have an old flame who I looked up and he was at the top of my list there, then he moved to the third one down (all three starting with the letter A), and I didn't look him up again, and then he moved to the top.  Hard to say but I would guess the one's at the top are looking at your profile.",
                    "Mutual friends show up first. As you type close to some name and the results are not your friends and you had never visited their profiles, then it is someone who visited you recently.  Also the pages and people you visit the most pop up first.",
                    "I am actually almost certain it has to do with people who view your page because I was thinking about this and conducted a little experiment (it's kinda confusing but bear with me).  I started off by typing every letter of the alphabet and seeing who came up on the search. So for example, I typed \"A\" and saw who came up. I noticed that the list of people were not necessarily in alphabetical order, but the people at the top were certainly my closest friends whose pages I visit all the time.  Then I thought maybe Facebook sets the search bar up conveniently for you to find the people you visit the most. But then I saw something strange, the girl that I just added was actually the second person in the \"L\" list, the first being my best friend, so that seemed odd to me.  So then I started thinking that it might actually have to do with the people who visit your page. To test the theory, I went to my \"C\" list, where the top two people were actually pretty much equal in terms of how many times I've visited their page and I assume they've visited mine. I went to the second person in the \"C\" list and clicked on their page a lot, refreshed it a few good times. Then I went back and searched \"C\" and sure enough, it was now the second friend whose page I had been refreshing who showed up first . I knew that this second friend was camping and had no Facebook/no way of looking at my page.  Now here's the real kicker: I told my other friend in the \"C\" list, the one who used to be first when I searched \"C\" to go on my page a couple of times. She did. I then took a couple of minutes and searched \"C\" again, and guess who came up first?  That's right, the girl who had just searched my page, despite the fact that I had been looking up the other girl's page recently.  Does this really prove that the Facebook search bar operates on people who have viewed your profile? Maybe, but it could also prove that I have WAY too much time on my hands.",
                    "When I go on to my boyfriend's profile and type the letter C in his search bar then the first result is his ex girlfriend, whom he is not friends with on facebook, so I think it can show up the people who look at your page as he swears he's only been on her page once in the last year and a half and yet she shows up ahead of his friends pages. If this is not the case, he'll be single soon!",
                    "I've been watching my friends search for a while..a little OCD... LOL  and when I search someone who is a friend on facebook and one who is not a friend the most recent searched person moves to the top. I stopped looking at the one who is not a facebook friend expecting him to move down the list and he did for a while staying steady in the same spot for months then he went to the top of my list for weeks...This happened many times so I finally asked him about it and he denies looking at my profile but I don't believe him.  it seems as though facebook keeps track of who you search first then who searches you(unless they look a lot then they go to the 1st position) then anyone you private message then ones you have the most interaction with.",
                    "I finally figured out the Facebook search bar trick!! So for years there's been this rumor that the search bar is the key to finding out who views your FB. They say it's just a legend... Not really!! So legend has it that if you type in a letter, the first result is either the person you searched for/looked at last... Or if you never have, that person has looked at you! Or they search for you frequently, or both.  ( It also works based on interaction, for friends especially, but I have found this to work for friends who never interact with you, as well as friends of friends who have never had interaction.)  So I conducted a little experiment and found out that the trick does work - but ONLY IF YOU'RE BOTH SEARCHING \u00a0for each other! That's the missing link. I had someone view me... Nothing. They were still in position 4 down from the top. I search for someone else, who has not viewed me, and nothing - they're still a low result. But then I search for the person who viewed me on the same day, and boom! Less than 3 hours later, they were result number one when I typed in their first or last name initials!! Incidently, this works for friends, or friends of friends, even those who only have one mutual friend in common with you!  (Important: don't try to cheat by partially typing their name. First initial only, for first or last names! Also, this works for the full-site FB, which I use on my phone as a modification to the mobile FB. It does not work with the iPhone app.)  If you search for someone, friend or not, they will still show in your top 5 results for up to a day or so, then they rank lower and not even show in your top 3 if you don't search again. If you search for someone and they instantly (about 3 hours later) rank 1st after that, they've been searching for/looking at you too! If they eventually drop in ranking, either another one of your friends with the same initials interacted with you recently, or you're the only interested party...  Of course, this will be difficult to track if you're stalking them and click on them several times a day, LOL! But I've found that one single search is enough to set it off. ( I keep track of my searches by using the search log. Clearing your searches can throw off results after a couple of hours, too.) I've tried this experiment on multiple days... Same results. (In case you're wondering where I find the time, the answer is that I don't sleep a lot!)"

This is not a real spam message, but   rather one that is trying to purposely   get into the spam folder of another   account. This is so that I can ensure   that my Gmail filters are setup   correctly.   ... and a subject line such as:   Test Spam Message 1   I always incremented the number at the end of the subject for each message I sent. This way it doesn't look like a duplicate to Gmail and is actually delivered.  Next, on the receiving account, I decided to go ahead and mark the message as spam. I read in the help that it mentions that marking a message as spam is reversible. They even give an example of how a user might accidentally mark a message as spam, then undo it. This is exactly what I am hoping to emulate.  After marking the first message as spam, all the others (which contain the exact same body and only differ in the subject by one letter) are sent to spam as well.  Once I was done with the testing, I marked all the messages as non-spam. Hopefully Gmail treats this as a user accidentally marking a message as spam and doesn't resort to blacklisting the address or doing something worse.  Update: After trying this again, I had to mark a message as spam twice before anything started happening, and then I noticed weird behaviors on the account that was sending the \"spam\". The account was automatically logged off, and I couldn't log back in for a while. This might be an automated measure Gmail takes when users report other Gmail users as spammers.",

Why not just put the test email account as a plain link on your homepage - you can then guarantee that spam will be targeting that account within a few hours.",

Now to add destination, you can not do on the browser since there is no \"+\" sign there anymore once you already have activated the route. To add further, go to the map layout in the right pane and click on full map view ....  Once you click on the full map view, the route option with  a \"+\" will come again in the map browser window. Add the destination and hit list all steps . There you go...  Thanks and enjoy.",

                    "Or after you have added your starting and end point instead of using the \"Car\" as your method of travel, switch it to \"Walking\" and the plus sign shows up, put in all your destination, rearrange them whatever you need to do, then switch it back to Car and now you have all your stop points with actual addresses and estimated travel time.  Works for me like a charm, just had to do it today.",
                    "Simply start out by getting directions from your departure point to your first destination.   Click the + beneath your travel points, then enter your third destination.   You can continue for as many destinations as you need, up to 10 maximum .     Another nice feature is if you get some of your steps out of order, you can drag the circle to the left of the destination in the list up our down to get it in the right spot.  Here's a link to a set of directions using your sample cities: Birmingham \u2192 Peterborough \u2192 London  (This assumes that your country has the latest version of Google Maps and that they have enough data in your country to support this. You'll also need a modern browser. I used Chrome to create these screen shots.)  Note also that this only seems to work for driving, walking, and biking directions. It doesn't work for flights or mass transit."

If however these files are of 'normal' sensitivity then the risk of bad press will usually be enough to guarantee they're good behaviour, after all your files are probably worth less to them than your (even potential) subscription fees.",

The only way to be 100% sure that you alone have access to your files is to encrypt them or host the service yourself. In the latter case, you should be aware that any large company is probably going to be able to do backup and security better than you.  Finally - A company like dropbox has better things to do than to go through your files. I would suggest that for larger / more well known companies, your files will probably be safe.

Your password never leaves your computer.  Wuala employs the 128 bit AES, 2048 bit RSA and SHA-256 algorithms for   encryption, signatures and integrity checks. If you're interested in   how Wuala manages encryption, have a look at our publication on   Cryptree.   Convincing enough for me."
