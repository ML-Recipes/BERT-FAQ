How do I delete my Facebook account?
</question>
<answer>
   from here :   Go here: http://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account  Click "Submit" and follow the instructions.  Your account will be deactivated for two weeks, and if you DO NOT USE FACEBOOK IN ANY WAY during that period, your account is permanently deleted.       
</answer>
<answer>
   Go to "Your Account".  Go to "Deactivate Account".  Facebook is a megalomaniac.  It will never ever ever EVER delete your profile.  If you decide ten years later to sign in, then it will still be there.  I'd erase my pictures from the site before deleting my account.  Actually, I just did last week.      
</answer>
<answer>
   It is not neccessary to go through the deactivation 2 week wait, you can delete your account directly at:  www.facebook.com/help/delete_account   If you do not think you will use Facebook again and would like your account deleted, we can take care of this for you. Keep in mind that you will not be able to reactivate your account or retrieve any of the content or information you have added.       
</answer>
<answer>
   There's a step by step YouTube guide on how to delete a Facebook account. There's also this blog article guiding you through the process.  Note that deactivating your Facebook account only makes Facebook temporarily unavailable; it will be reactivated once you login again to your account. So if you are 100% sure you want to delete your account account, only then go for the delete option. It may take 15 days to completely delete your Facebook account.

<question>
How do I add new styles to Google docs?
</question>
<answer>
   Right now it's not possible to add more styles or rename the existed ones, but you can modify them to match your needs.  For example you could style your code as you wish and then by selecting one of the headers and choosing the Update Heading # to match selection , that particular style could become your new "Code" style.  Then select something else and apply that heading and you're done.       
</answer>
<answer>
   As Lipis poins out, you still cannot create your own styles. So, you are left to repurpose an existing one. The downside to using Heading is this will result in "code" in my TOC. :/ I found that using Subtitle style for code prevents it from showing in TOC.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Until recently, it was possible to edit the CSS (stylesheet) and HTML source of a document. It took some work, but if you knew HTML and CSS you could add a CSS class to your doc, and then edit the HTML to use it, e.g. in the HTML  &lt;span class='booktitle'&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/span&gt;  and in the CSS  .booktitle { font-style:italic; }  Google has more or less phased out this capability with their new format, forcing old docs to the new format. But, I've heard there are ways to keep docs in the old format, so there may be some hope.      
</answer>
<answer>
   The gratis Google Docs extension Paragraph Styles+ allows to create custom paragraph styles (plus decimal system outline numbering for headings and a table of contents with page numbering).  I just tested it, and here's my first impression:   Good start. For small-ish documents, it should be good to use :-)  However it runs quite slow, even though recent versions improved on the performance already.  The UI does not integrate with the Google Docs style UI. Probably not possible otherwise in the Google Docs API.  The original Google Docs style feature does not know about custom styles, considering all text with custom styles as having the "Normal text" format. You can use both in parallel, but note that the "Clear formatting" button (looks like " T x ") will remove custom style formatting from selected text.  It seems to store your character styles on an external web service, means you have to entrust them access to your documents the way you entrust them to Google now …   Source: Acknowledging the comment by Chris Moschini above, who mentioned it first.

   This may not be for everyone (I work in web development), and it's slow, but if you use Chrome or Chromium you can edit the HTML directly and it works fine.   Right-click on the text you want to strike out  Choose 'inspect element'  The inspector will bring up that text - right click on it and choose 'edit html'  Wrap the text you want to strike out with &lt;strike&gt;text&lt;/strike&gt;

How do I link a cell in Google Spreadsheets to a cell in another document?
</question>
<answer>
   IMPORTRANGE() appears to be the function you want.  From the Google spreadsheets function list :   Google Spreadsheets lets you reference   another workbook in the spreadsheet   that you're currently editing by using   the ImportRange function. ImportRange   lets you pull one or more cell values   from one spreadsheet into another. To   create your own ImportRange formulas,   enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,   range). For languages where comma is   used for decimal separation, use a   semicolon instead of a comma to   separate arguments in your formula.  Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is   the key value from the spreadsheet   URL.  Range is a STRING representing the   range of cells you want to import,   optionally including the sheet name   (defaults to first sheet). You can   also use a range name if you prefer.  Given that the two arguments are   STRINGs, you need to enclose them in   quotes or refer to cells which have   string values in them.  For example:  =importrange("abcd123abcd123", "sheet1!A1:C10") "abcd123abcd123" is   the value in the "key=" attribute on   the URL of the target spreadsheet and   "sheet1!A1:C10" is the range which is   desired to be imported.  =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1   contains sheet1!A1:C10  Note: In order to use ImportRange, you   need to have been added as a viewer or   collaborator to the spreadsheet from   which ImportRange is pulling the data.   Otherwise, you'll get this error:   "#REF! error: The requested   spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell   range was not found."   "key" is of course the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter.  I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first I put a string. In cell A1 of the second I put =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A","A1") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.)  (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to be replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A";"A1") )  NOTES:   Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 "cross-workbook reference formulas" per spreadsheet. Source: Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides size limits . (h/t JJ Rohrer )  The "new" Google Spreadsheet (soon to be the standard) removes the 50 limit of 50 "cross-workbook reference formulas ( Google Support ) (h/t Jacob Jan Tuinstra )   In the "new" Google Sheets you also use the entire URL as the key ( Google Support ) (h/t Punchlinern )       
</answer>
<answer>
   FYI if you want to reference another sheet within that other spreadsheet, the sheet name should NOT be re-quoted:  use  =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A","Sheet Name!A1:A10")  instead of  =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A","'Sheet Name'!A1:A10")      
</answer>
<answer>
   In the new interface, you should simply be able to type = in the cell, then just go to the other sheet and pick the cell you want. If you want to do it manually, or are using the old interface, you can simply do =Sheet1!A1 , where Sheet1 is the name of the sheet, and A1 is the cell on that sheet you care about. This is identical to Microsoft Excel.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I found this syntax using Insert -&gt; Define new range RANGE FOR REFERENCING OTHER SPREADSHEET:   Whole A column: 'Spreadsheet With Spaces in the name'!A:A  Whole B column: 'Spreadsheet With Spaces in the name'!B:B   etc.  Then you can use it as:   =COUNTIF('First Page'!B:B, "valueToMatch")       
</answer>
<answer>
   here is how i did it (reimplemented 'importrange()'):   open the script editor ("tools" -&gt; "scripts" -&gt; "script editor")  provide a function like this (without any checks, this has to be improved but you get the general idea):   function REMOTEDATA(inKey, inRange) {    var outData;     var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById(inKey);    if (ss) {      outData = ss.getRange(inRange).getValues();   }    return outData; }   use this formula like this in your spreadsheet:   =SUM(REMOTEDATA("key", "SheetName!A1:A10"))  "key" is the key of the document, you find it in the "key=xyz" parameter of the document url.  the documentation for ' spreadsheet services ' provides more information on the topic.

   You can convert a Markdown document to HTML, and copy/paste the HTML page (not the source) into a Google Drive document. It will retain most of the formatting including headings, lists, links, bold/italic/underline.  The font, margins, and font sizes will not match the Google Drive defaults, and will look "out of place" compared to standard Google Drive documents. Applying a custom CSS file to the HTML document will solve this, making the document look very similar.  I'm not sure about the other direction, converting Google Drive documents to Markdown. It may be possible to export to HTML and use an HTML to Markdown converter.

<answer>
   gdocs2md does a good job of converting Google documents to markdown, retaining headers, lists, tables, italics, bold, links and images. I use it to allow shared editing of documents, then export to markdown.  Some care does need to be taken to use formatting in the Google document that maps well to markdown, but this isn't particularly difficult. I've also extended the script to support exporting an entire folder of documents to a new "export" folder on Google Drive, and to slightly improve handling of italic and bold formatting, my fork is here .

<answer>
   A Google Docs document encodes everything in 'elements' within the Kix editor that it's all based on (it's closed source as basically this is the big trade secret, with which anyone else could run their own Docs service - which is a shame imo).  You can access these elements with Google Apps Script, a variant of Javascript - but writing Markdown from the elements isn't as straightforward as you'd think (you have to essentially implement a markdown parser in Apps Script).  When I came to do this earlier in the year there were dozens of forks of Renato Mangini's " gdocs2md " repo, but he seemed to have stopped fielding pull requests, and over the period of a few years forks had appeared that were far better than others. I went through many of these in the tree and put the best into a new package, which also generates HTML mixed with the markdown for elements Google Docs supports such as superscript and subscript elements (which markdown has no way of representing). Even incorporating the best of others' edits, the parsing needed work, and I'm confident that this is the best available for the job at present.  Script available on GitHub with installation instructions:  lmmx/gdocs2md-html  I also worked on adding in the most important feature to such a script - user features - providing the markdown in a pop-up within Google Docs rather than saving to file (I think the original was batch saving for entire folders, which is not suitable for my document-drafting needs, or how I use Google Docs at all).    I'd like to suggest it be a single more sophisticated project for interested developers to collaborate on (or at least suggest features for) rather than everyone forking off scripts of various quality, when we're likely working to the same aims.  As well as reducing duplication of effort, the Google Docs policy for creation of "add-ons" states that to be published (and therefore 'installable' rather than needing to be loaded for each document in a slightly awkward manner)    The add-on must be fully functional — it can't be a “work in progress.”  The script has been tested with multiple active users.    Obviously if you wanted a "pure" markdown then either switch off these features (the code is there to fork) or just don't use sub/superscripts, etc. It wouldn't be too difficult to add personalised settings to such a script if it matures as an add-on, if there's significant interest.

   Download and install the Google Drive software. It's for Windows and Mac at the moment, a version for Linux is in the making. The software will create a folder on your computer that syncs with Google Drive. If you open a file in it, it will be opened in the appropriate installed program.

   Assuming that once you're done making a document in markdown you want to convert it into a true google document (as opposed to being able to preview the document in the google drive web interface and continue editing in markdown syntax) so that others unfamiliar with markdown can collaborate I've found the following fairly quick:   Create your mark down wherever's convenient.  When done export to the browser  Copy the resulting text from the browser  Paste into a new Google Doc   Google docs is ready to have HTML pasted in so it'll preserve all the headings, spacing, lists, and other formats.  Of course this only makes sense if you just want to personally work in markdown, but collaborate with others in a regular google doc.

A: Just open the page where the video or audio stream plays, and as   soon as it starts you will see a new   FlashGot Media status bar icon   flashing as a notification: you can   either left-click it to download all   the streams at once, or right-click to   choose among multiple streams, if more   than one have been found.   Alternatively, you can press ctrl+F7   or select the FlashGot Media command   from your context menu.

   Some videos (like the Vevo ones) get streamed; I haven't figured out how to save them yet.  But for the bulk of videos, they get saved to the computer's temporary folder until the video is navigated away from. On a Linux or Mac OS X computer, it's relatively easy to find and copy the temporary file elsewhere (renaming it to a .flv if it is a Flash video).  On Windows, the file's locked, so you need to use something like HoboCopy to copy it, which requires administrator rights and command-line usage. In places where you don't have administrator rights, like a computer lab, I launch a logging proxy ( Fiddler2 's lightweight and easy) to intercept all HTTP traffic, but this slows down all your browsing while it's capturing.  Usually, though, sites like KeepVid will work again later if you give them time.

How can I filter my Gmail messages that aren't labeled?

<answer>
   Updated: There is a blog today about updated Gmail search modifiers that allow you to do this with a simple search!  has:nouserlabels  Note: Because of Gmails threading you will have labels on some of the messages in the derived list because some messages in a thread will have labeling while some won't. (From Gmail Help - Advanced Search site .)  Original answer:  The Gmail advanced search help page says:   label: Search for messages by label*  There isn't a search operator for unlabeled messages  Example: from:amy label:friends Meaning: Messages from Amy that have the label "friends"  Example: from:david label:my-family Meaning: Messages from David that have the label "My Family"       
</answer>
<answer>
   One way you can do it is by using the minus operator on the label operator. So for example:  -label:tag-a -label:tag-b -label:tag-c  or for one-word tags:  -label:{taga tagb tagc}  This is probably only practical if you don't have a lot of labels.  Additionally, if they don't change often, you can include a link to this search so that it easily accessible from Gmail. There is a Google Labs product which puts a box of links on the left side and allows you to customize them. Just add a link to this search query and you'll be able to access your untagged messages easily.  It seems like there is a greasemonkey script which will work too. Here is the script's website . It creates a special label, Unlabelled , to search for all the conversations without a real label.      
</answer>

   In my case I had lots of rubbish in the All Mail folder, mail that should have been deleted but accumulated there for some reason.

   I would try:  has:nouserlabels -in:trash -is:chat -in:inbox

</question>
<answer>
   You can report this to Facebook requesting that they remove the account or memorialize the account.  From Facebook FAQ:   How do I report a deceased user or an account that needs to be   memorialized and deactivated or   deleted?   Memorializing the account:  Please report this information here so   that we can memorialize this person’s   account. Memorializing the account   restricts profile access to confirmed   friends only. Please note that in   order to protect the privacy of the   deceased user, we cannot provide login   information for the account to anyone.   We do honor requests from close family   members to close the account   completely.  Removing the account:  Immediate family   members may request the removal of a   loved one’s account. This will   completely remove the account from   Facebook so that no one can view it.   We will not restore the account or   provide information on its content   unless required by law. If you are   requesting a removal and are not an   immediate family member of the   deceased, your request will not be   processed, but the account will be   memorialized.  To make a request to memorialize or   remove a profile, please do so here .   If you have a special request   regarding a deceased user's account,   please use this form. Please note that this form is only to be used for   accounts that have already been   memorialized.   The Facebook FAQ page can be found here      
</answer>
<answer>
   The account can be memorialised;   When an account is memorialized, we also set privacy so that only confirmed friends can see the profile or locate it in search. We try to protect the deceased's privacy by removing sensitive information such as contact information and status updates. Memorializing an account also prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, while still enabling friends and family to leave posts on the profile Wall in remembrance.   http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=163091042130  http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=842      
</answer>
<answer>
   When my cousin died, the account was memorialized, meaning that the Wall is left open for comments. Facebook has a page about the process.   When a user passes away, we memorialize their account to protect their privacy. Memorializing an account sets the account privacy so that only confirmed friends can see the profile or locate it in search. The Wall remains, so friends and family can leave posts in remembrance. Memorializing an account also prevents anyone from logging into the account.       
</answer>
<answer>
   As of September 22, 2015  If you passed away you have 2 options, and actually you can tell it to Facebook in advance by going to the Facebook settings then security   request for memorialization upon death  request for account deletion upon death    Facebook has a form for deceased person namely Special Request for Deceased Person's Account , see the form here .  Legacy contact allows them to   Write a pinned post for your profile (ex: to share a final message     on your behalf or provide information about a memorial service)  Respond to new friend requests (ex: old friends or family members     who weren't yet on Facebook)  Update your profile picture and cover     photo   Your legacy contact can't:   Log into your account  Remove or change past posts, photos and other things shared on your Timeline  Read messages you've sent to other friends  Remove any of your friends       
</answer>
<answer>
   Facebook allows you memorialise or deactivate the Facebook account. Taking action in relation to the deceased person's Facebook account as quickly as possible is highly recommended.  You can close your account by using a service like enclosure.com.au (which closes all of the person's social networking accounts) or by going straight to Facebook.

   Now there is: Format Text as Table .  I've been meaning to create this utility for a while. I was actually inspired by MySQL's command line utility and the lack of tables on SO. So thanks for reminding me to make it.  And thanks to @Lipis for the Unicode char idea.  Here's an example of the output:  +------+--------+--------+ |      | ColA   | ColB   | +------+--------+--------+ | Row1 | CellA1 | CellB1 | | Row2 | CellA2 | CellB2 | | Row3 | CellA3 | CellB3 | +------+--------+--------+

   Since the OP specifically says:   It doesn't have to use ASCII (it can be Unicode)   I thought I'd share the link for the (mysql / unicode / html) table generator created by a SE user for use on SE I found on superuser . I found it quite useful to get unicode tables (which I sometimes prefer over the Windows-1252 compatible "ASCII" art). And this tool lets you compare the outputs, as well as getting a HTML formatted table, too.  Example to show my workflow: I'm making a web app for my bookkeeper to calculate sales tax and I am doing math on months and quarters so that the tool always automatically displays "last quarter's sales tax info" . Since  I'm always thinking of arrays starting with 0, I needed to embed a simple table outlining the months in each quarter to keep the values sorted in my head.  1) To get the table started, I used this generator (listed on both this and the other QA) with its Excel-like input interface to actually create the data, as the unicode tool wants pre-formatted text. I type in the values then select them and CTRL-C to get my tab delimited table:  Quarter Numbers Names Q1  1, 2, 3 Jan, Feb, Mar Q2  4, 5, 6 Apr, May, Jun Q3  7, 8, 9 Jul, Aug, Sep Q4  10, 11, 12  Oct, Nov, Dec  2) went to senseful's generator and pasted into the input area. I played with each of the 3 options and I liked the Unicode Art option the best:  ╔═════════╦════════════╦═══════════════╗ ║ Quarter ║  Numbers   ║     Names     ║ ╠═════════╬════════════╬═══════════════╣ ║ Q1      ║ 1, 2, 3    ║ Jan, Feb, Mar ║ ║ Q2      ║ 4, 5, 6    ║ Apr, May, Jun ║ ║ Q3      ║ 7, 8, 9    ║ Jul, Aug, Sep ║ ║ Q4      ║ 10, 11, 12 ║ Oct, Nov, Dec ║ ╚═════════╩════════════╩═══════════════╝  Note that for the table to show up correctly on a web page, the character set must be specifically set for UTF-8:  &lt;meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type'/&gt;

<answer>
   With the release of the Data Export feature , you can now   Go to your board  Click the "Board Menu" button (on the right-hand-side of the screen)  Select "Share, Print, and Export"  Click "JSON"   This will download a copy of your board data.  Pro tips:   You can also just add .json (or /somename.json) to the end of a board or card URL, to get the prompt to save the downloaded file  (e.g. https://trello.com/board/welcome-board/4e6a8095efa69909ba007382/somename.json )  Alternatively, instead of clicking on the "JSON" button, you can right-click on it, and copy the URL  If you have lots of boards that you want to download regularly, you'll have to save all the JSON links somewhere for all your boards, and download each one individually.  Changing the names of all these individual files for each set of backups could get a little tedious, so one idea would be to create a new folder each time you backup your boards, and then save a set of exported files into that folder.

How can I import a large list of tasks into Trello
</question>
<answer>
   I wrote a bookmarklet to help with this task.  It's very crude and it works for me today, but I've only tested it briefly and only in Chrome.  It calls some JavaScript functions in Trello directly so it's extremely likely that it will break when they update the site.  Hopefully it works for you, but please don't use it if your data is critical in case it mangles it.  If you want to try it out, you can get the code from here .  There's both a readable version, and a version suitable for copying into a bookmarklet.  To use:   Go here , select the entire contents ("javascript:..." to "...%29%28%29%3B") and copy to the clipboard.  Create a new bookmark, call it something like "Trello - Add Many" and paste the contents from step 1 into the URL field for the bookmark.  Go to the Trello board you want to add items to and click the bookmark.  An overlay should appear that will let you select the list you want to add cards to, and enter a number of new card titles -- one per line.  The overlay will disappear when you hit "Submit".  If you want to get rid of the overlay without adding any new cards then just refresh the page.   Note: If you're trying to get your tasks out of Google Tasks and into Trello then choose Actions - Print task list in Google Tasks, copy the tasks from the printable view, and paste into the bookmarklet's entry box.

How to specify “OR” conditions for Gmail filter
</question>
<answer>
   Type into the search field of Gmail:  from:xyz OR to:uvw  see also here .  to make a filter (and apply actions to that filter) from that search: click the little down arrow on the right side of the search field and then click create filter with this search .      
</answer>
<answer>
   If you are talking about searching, then @akira's question is correct. However, it sounds like you are asking about how to use this condition in a filter.  The trick is that you can put whatever search criteria you want in the filter's Has the words field. For any other field it will prefix your criteria with the field name. For example, if you type user@example.com in the To field, it'll create the filter condition to:(user@example.com) . The reason it works in the Has the words field, is because it doesn't prefix it with anything. This is because it acts as a normal search on the content of the email.   Create or modify a filter.  In the Has the words field, enter your OR condition. For example: to:user@example.com OR from:user@example.com   This is also the place to put any other attributes you want to match (e.g. label: , in: , etc.).  This will also work in the Show search options page, however it's easier to just use a normal search instead.      
</answer>
<answer>
   To my surprise, the solution to me was using the vertical bar | between emails instead of the comma , in the TO filed during filter creation.  Example:  name1@domain.com | name2@domain.com | name3@domain.com`  The search box would look like:  to:(name1@domain.com | name2@domain.com | name3@domain.com)  I got a popup message from Gmail saying that using special characters may give unexpected results. Just clicked on continue and it worked perfectly.

Embed Google Spreadsheet in Google Document
</question>
<answer>
   From today (2016-05-20) on, Google is starting to roll out the ability to embed a chart from a Google spreadsheet into a Google document. At this point, two of my 3 Google accounts make the option available in the Insert menu, with a new Insert→Chart submenu below the Insert→Drawing… item.  When you insert such charts, they remain linked to the original spreadsheet. If all you want is tabular data, there's a table chart type that you can use to present your data as a simple table.  There are some limitations at this stage (e.g. regarding the size of the chart) and the chart must pre-exist in the spreadsheet before you can insert it, but this is going in the right direction…  The chart is not updated live if you modify the source spreadsheet while your document is opened, however, the document will detect changes and offer you to update your chart to reflect the latest changes in the source.      
</answer>
<answer>
   AFAIK, you can only copy and paste from the spreadsheet to the text document. The spreadsheet is inserted as a table, but they are not linked: if you change something in the Spreadsheet, it will not get reflected in the text document.  Of course, I'd absolutely love to be proved wrong!      
</answer>
<answer>
   Here is a script-based solution which allows one to insert a table with the contents from a given range within a given spreadsheet. I did not try to find a way to sync data real-time, as it didn't seem practical given potentially large volume of data that would have to be transferred with every edit to the spreadsheet. Instead, the script adds a custom menu item "update data" to the document.  The script should be bound to the document (i.e., created using Tools &gt; Script Editor in the document menu). The spreadsheet URL, as well as the sheet and range to use, are specified within the script. To embed all the data on the sheet, replace .getRange(rangeName) with .getDataRange() .  When the function updateData is first executed, it appends the table at the end of document. At subsequent runs, it updates the table in place (i.e., if  more text is added after the table, the order will be preserved).  Note that cutting-pasting the table would break the updating process (the script would add a new table at the end) since the pasted copy is a new object. Instead, cut-paste the text around the table.  function onOpen() {   DocumentApp.getUi()              .createMenu('Custom')              .addItem('Update Data', 'updateData')              .addToUi(); }  function updateData() {   var ssUrl = ' spreadsheet url here ';   var sheetName = 'Sheet2';   // name of sheet to use   var rangeName = 'A1:C3';    // range of values to include     var values = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(ssUrl)                              .getSheetByName(sheetName)                              .getRange(rangeName)                              .getValues();   var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();   var body = doc.getBody();   var ranges = doc.getNamedRanges('embeddedSheet-range');   if (ranges.length == 0) {     var table = body.appendTable(values);   }   else {     tableRange = ranges[0];     table = tableRange.getRange().getRangeElements()[0].getElement();     var ind = body.getChildIndex(table);     tableRange.remove();     body.removeChild(table);     table = body.insertTable(ind, values);   }   var rangeBuilder = doc.newRange();   rangeBuilder.addElement(table);   doc.addNamedRange('embeddedSheet-range', rangeBuilder.build()); }  Technical notes   It's also possible to sync the data every hour, in addition to manually. Just add a time-based trigger from Script Editor's Resources menu, so that it runs the function updateData.  One can also adapt this script to be bound to the source spreadsheet instead. This would require changes in how the document is opened (e.g., by URL), but otherwise the logic is the same.  The cumbersome part of the script is getting the handle of the existing table in the document. This requires placing it within a Named Range. Also, it is much more expedient to completely replace the table element than to mess with the entries of an existing table. Since a Named Range is immutable, it is also removed with the table it contains, and then created again, along with the new table.

How do I split conversations in Gmail?
</question>
<answer>
   Unfortunately it is not possible to split Gmail threads. However, you can mark some messages as "unread from here". When you reply, change the title and reply in a new composing window, so that at least the follow-ups are split.      
</answer>
<answer>
   You can also turn off conversation view, which is a new Gmail feature as of today:  http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/turn-off-gmails-conversation-view.html      
</answer>
<answer>
   You could always forward the conversation to yourself with a new subject. You'll lose the original sender, but you can add that to the message body so it's still searchable.      
</answer>
<answer>
   When replying you can change the subject, that will push the conversation from that point forward to a new conversation.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Yes, you can split conversations using a regular IMAP-client. Move one of the two messages to a different folder (label) using the IMAP-client and then move it back to the original folder (label).  If you set the draft flag in your external IMAP-client you can also edit the message to add keywords etc.      
</answer>
<answer>
   We (Streak) just added the ability to split up threads into smaller ones by selecting messages you want to move to a new thread. If you're still looking for this feature it may be helpful: https://www.streak.com/split-gmail-conversation-threads-break

</question>
<answer>
   For Chrome users, the official Personal Blocklist Chrome extension can remove sites from your results. Unlike the one referenced in Bernhard Hofmann's answer , this is an official extension developed by Google.  For Firefox users, there is a similar extension called Hide Unwanted Results of Google Search .  Google used to have built-in support for this , but it has removed this feature. If you used this feature, you can still download your block list as a text file .

   There is a search results Chrome extension for filtering search results:  https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ddgjlkmkllmpdhegaliddgplookikmjf?hl=en-gb  I just installed it and added expertSexChange.com to my black list. :D

<answer>
   I sometimes use  this solution when I have to search specific topics, like Hardware Reviews , Programming Issue , etc.  I define a Custom Search Engine query, that works as a white-list of web sites. Follow the wizards and then save the HTML code provided by Google at the end on a file on your PC. When you have to do certain type of search just open that file.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I and many others have found the plugins don't work but you can create your own blocklist using a browser's native functions.  In Chrome, open Settings and click on Manage Search Engines .  Scroll down to the bottom and add a new search engine. You'll have to add a duplicate Google (call it whatever you like) and make that your default search engine because Chrome won't allow you to modify the search string for its Google entry.  In the right most field the base search string would be something like this (I live in oz) where %s = your search terms:  https://google.com.au/#q=%s  To exclude trash sites from your search, add them after the %s in URL format,  excluding 'Junk Site' and 'Spam Factory' would be:  https://google.com.au/#q=%s+-%22Junk+Site%22+-%22Spam+Factory%22  If you use Chrome's Omnibox (the URL / search bar at the top) it will automatically append this to your searches, e.g., -"Junk Site" -"Spam Factory" . If you use Google's search box (the one between "Google" and the little microphone) your search it won't, i.e., your search will be unfiltered.      
</answer>

   No ... there is is no current way to remove web sites from your Google Search results.  At least, not if you are using Firefox as of 8/9/2011.

How do I delete a list or card in Trello?
</question>
<answer>
   Unfortunately, no for lists and boards (for the moment). Card delete has been added since launch. Trello blog gives the answer as follows:   Can I delete a board/list/card and make it go away forever?  Trello doesn't have board or list delete. Archive and close have a   similar effect. Card delete has been added since launch.  To delete a card, first archive it, then click delete from the sidebar   back of the card OR click 'view archive' from the board sidebar, find   the card, and delete it.   I've also found this bug annoying and contacted them.  Edit: Card delete has been added since launch.      
</answer>
<answer>
   At the moment, there is no way to "delete" a list on Trello - you can only archive it. Do this by clicking the arrow next to the list title:   and clicking "Archive This List". Archiving a list removes it from all views, just like deleting it would - but they are still resurrectable.

Force Google search to use only the exact words typed, no spellcheck or synonyms
</question>
<answer>
   There’s a couple of things you can do to stop Google from being “helpful”:   Add + before the terms that must be included in the result (you can also put them in quotes as you have said)  To make it the default mode (find all terms ), add as_q=all to the URL (this is not as effective as specifically prepending + )   Click the “Showing results for… Search instead for…” link to search for what you typed instead of what Google thinks you meant  To make it the default mode, add &amp;nfpr=1 to the URL    So Googling for one of these should give only pages that have what you are looking for:  http://www.google.com/search?nfpr=1&amp;as_q=all&amp;q=Mayavi+plot3D+vary+tube+radius  http://www.google.com/search?nfpr=1&amp;q=Mayavi+plot3D+%2Bvary+tube+%2Bradius      
</answer>
<answer>
   Here are two articles about changes Google has made to search which affect required terms. First Google started silently ignoring some of the search terms included in multiple term searches (making all search terms required by default was one of the reasons I originally liked Google better than Yahoo). Then more recently they stopped supporting the "+" to force term inclusion, apparently because they want to use that in searches involving Google+.  Google Just Made Bing the Best Search Engine  Google Kills Its Other Plus, and How to Bring It Back  In years past, I could have searched for things like the following and only gotten pages that had all these terms:   bengals highlights simpson   I would only double-quote exact phrases I wanted matched, such as "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"  When I noticed the first change above several months ago, I started using the + operator, which had been previously redundant:   +bengals +highlights +simpson   Now it appears we have to separately double-quote each term we require which is a pain:   "bengals" "highlights" "simpson"

Note: They will only be notified if they have notifications turned on, or they constantly monitor their list of followers to see if it is changing.

   Twitter is starting to roll out the ability for anyone to request an archive of all of their tweets .  Official Twitter blog: Your Twitter archive  Apparently it works similarly to Facebook's archive option. If the option is turned on for you, you'll see a link for "Your Twitter Archive" in Twitter Settings. Once you've made the request, and after some amount of time, an email message with a ZIP file of your Twitter messages will arrive in your inbox.

   You can also use SocialSafe to backup the content of your Twitter account. Again, it is restricted by the API limit of the most recent 3,200 tweets when you start backing up, but as others have said, the sooner the start backing up the less you'll miss. All of the content is stored on your own PC/Mac, so you aren't sharing your data with anyone.  SocialSafe backs up the following:   Tweets  Mentions  DMs  Favourites  Followers  Following  Profile information   There is a free trial available that allows you full usage of SocialSafe, which also includes the capability of exporting to CSV.

I came up with this workaround that might be worth a try in extreme cases:   create an empty repository  add a README.md to it containing your message and include a reply email  go to the Settings of that repository  send the repository via Transfer Ownership to the user in question   This should produce a notification for the user and allow him to contact you.  In cases when a user account is completely dead and you just want to get rid of it so that you can use the name for your own projects, you can also contact support, they will remove dead accounts:  https://help.github.com/articles/name-squatting-policy/

   This question has an answer at Stack Overflow .   Although GitHub removed the private messaging feature, there's still an alternative.  GitHub host git repositories. If the user you're willing to communicate with has ever committed some code, there are good chances you may reach your goal. Indeed, within each commit is stored some information about the author of the change or the one who accepted it.  Provided you're really dying to exchange with user user_test   Display the public activity page of the user:  https://github.com/user_test?tab=activity  Search for an event stating "user_test pushed to [branch] at   [repository]" . There are usually good chances, he may have pushed one   of his own commits. Ensure this is the case by clicking on the "View    comparison..." link and make sure the user is listed as one of the committers.  Clone on your local machine the repository he pushed to: git clone   https://github.com/..../repository.git  Go to that directory cd repository  Checkout the branch he pushed to: git checkout [branch]  Display    the latest commits: git log -50   As a committer/author, an email should be displayed along with the commit data.  Note: Every warning related to unsolicited email should apply there. Do not spam.

In Gmail, how can I attach an attachment from one email to another, without saving the attachment first or forwarding the message?
</question>
<answer>
   The way I do this is to click the Forward option and then type in a new Subject and clear the message text so I have an new message but with the attachments in place.  I'd be surprised if there's a quicker way than this; entering a new Subject doesn't take that long.      
</answer>
<answer>
   This isn't a solution to your issue as such, but if it's not so much an issue of time taken to download the file, vs. convenience of attaching it, then in Chrome you can:   open the email  download it and it you get a button for it at the bottom of the Chrome window  create your new email and drag it back from the bottom of the Chrome window onto your email   So the only benefit of this method is that you don't have to search for the download in Windows Explorer / Finder and is therefore only marginally more convenient.  I feel your pain too though as this is something I do frequently in fat clients, so would welcome a proper answer.  I also don't like the faffiness of forwarding and replacing everything, so for me - on my 100Mbps connection :), my method works ok for any attachment size that Google can handle anyway.      
</answer>
<answer>
   You can now use Gmail's "Save to Drive" option, and then load the file in the other email from the Drive. This can be faster and more efficient than downloading the file and re-uploading it from your computer. If the user doesn't have access to the file, Gmail will prompt you to "share and send" when you send the email.      
</answer>
<answer>
   If the attachment is document that opens in Google docs, you can open it and email it from Google docs to new address. This bypasses transfer to desktop and re-upload.      
</answer>
<answer>
   You can also just hit "forward", and then change all aspects of the email, including the subject, and the receiver won't know the difference.  Some email applications like Thunderbird will flag the email as having been forwarded, but Gmail doesn't do this. It just determines how it initially sets up the email.  I believe this would be the easiest method for you, rather than using Google Docs.

   URL hacking for the rescue! You can append &amp;list=UL to the end of a video URL from that user.  So, if you have:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucBfXpCA6s  it should become:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucBfXpCA6s&amp;list=UL  ^ right here  You could also add something like this to your bookmark and simply click on it:  javascript:window.location+='&amp;list=UL'  Select it then drag and drop it on your bookmarks.  I couldn't figure out how to properly href it here in stackexchange! :(  Now, there is an issue ! It's got a weird behaviour as dear @burtek brought to my attention on the comments. In my instance here, with Valentina Lisitsa, she got 272 videos right now, but it won't ever show more than 99 on the list. And it seems like it's ordered from oldest to newest, so if you want to play all videos you rather start with the user's first video. In her case, this is it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS_foc_NxI0&amp;list=UL  From there you can leave it playing and it will play all her videos. The current video will always try to be in position #20 of the list, showing 19 previous ones and 79 next ones.

Click on "Play all" and it will generate a playlist with all the user's uploaded videos from newest to oldest.

   Little trick I found is to get a user's unique code/string from their profile page's source.  Here's how to do it:   Go to their user page and right-click -&gt; "view page source".  Search for "vnd" and copy the code that you find (It should start with "UC").  Open one of the user's videos.  In the URL address, add the following to the end: "&amp;list=" then paste the string you copied.  Final step is simply change the 2nd character of the code you pasted from a C to a U.  Hit enter and the video should reload, and now it appears in a playlist of all the user's videos.   This seems to work pretty reliably, but sometimes does not get all of the user's videos.

<answer>
   just put javascript:Array.prototype.slice.call(document.getElementsByClassName("addto-watch-later-button")).forEach(function(element, index, array){array[index].click();}) in url and hit enter, it adds every video on the current page to watch later list, nasty but it works.

   On Windows:  You could use Notepad++ to achieve the desired effect.   Open the source file in Notepad++.  Highlight the text you want to copy.  Right click and select Plugin commands &gt; Copy Text with Syntax Highlighting  Paste the text into Gmail.   On OS X:  TextMate has a copy-as-RTF that people are raving about. They use it to paste code with syntax highlighting on KeyNote.  From their GitHub page:  Need to copy + paste some text and keep the syntax highlighting?  Yes you do. All the time. For Keynote presentations. And probably other reasons.  Install this bundle, and after selecting some pretty syntax highlighted text, use  Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+R to copy it as RTF (rich text format) Now you can paste it directly   into Keynote presentations. And other places where RTF is supported.  Should work on Gmail's composer too.

   I tried removing all the variables except the q string. It seems to work fine. One thing to note is that Google uses the # symbol, instead of ? which you normally see with query strings.  So, as an example, the URL would be: http://google.com/#q=my+query      
</answer>
<answer>
   There are a bunch of other CGI parameters in the search results page URL that determine which corpus you’re seeing the results for (Images, Videos, etc.), the page of results, etc. among other things. q is the most important, but not the only one that should be included when sharing.  Some time ago, I wrote a Chrome extension to copy a shorter URL for Google search queries .  Disclaimer: I work at Google on Web Search.

</question>
<answer>
   Simply append #t=0m0s to the URL to point 0 minutes and 0 seconds past the start of the video. Replace the 0 with your desired values and the link will scrub forward the specified amount in your browser.   Although this wasn't a feature when I asked the question, Vimeo now supports this across the board.  The forum post with the announcement of this feature and an example of how to link to a moment inside a linked video:  http://vimeo.com/forums/topic:49396  Basically, by appending #t=1m5s you can request the playhead be moved to one minute (1m) and five seconds (5s) of the video, so in the case of my question, the URL would be #t=3m28s :  http://vimeo.com/36881035#t=3m28s

   Here's another good blog post about the frustrations of using Wolfram|Alpha. Until they work out the user interface problems, W|A will remain a curiosity. Once they do, a user should be able to fulfill the promise of being able to synthesize new ideas by juxtaposing data in new ways.  In the mean time, I only play around with it. There's very little depth I can access without a tremendous amount of gyration.  Also, the number of errors people have found in the data and calculations is discouraging.

   I have not but I would think that it would be great for journalists, authors, documentarians or anyone else who needs to get statistical data.

   Also useful for learning Mathematica itself.  For example you want to know how to integrate a function in Mathematica, then you enter  integrate x y dx  on Wolfram|Alpha and click on the result to see that the corresponding Mathematica plaintext input is  Integrate[x y, x]  Suppose you want to know how to graph a list of data points in Mathematica, you could enter  graph n^2 from 1 to 10  on Wolfram|Alpha and click on the 'Mathematica form' link (in the first box) to see that  Plot[n^2, {n, 1, 10}]  is the corresponding Mathematica form.

<question>
Link to specific sheet in Google spreadsheet
</question>
<answer>
   When you switch to a different sheet in Google Spreadsheets, pay attention to the URL in your browser's address bar. At the end of the URL you should see something like:  #gid=0  This number changes when you switch sheets, and specifies which sheet to display. Copy the entire URL and create a hyperlink to it with this formula:  =hyperlink("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsaQpHJE_LShcDJ0dWNudHFZWVJqS1dvb3FLWkVrS0E#gid=0", "LINK TEXT")   With a script  I've thought about this question a lot since I first wrote this answer, and I came up with a solution that involves a script.  With the spreadsheet open, click the Tools menu, then Script editor... . Paste all this code into the editor:  function onOpen(event) {   var ss = event.source;   var menuEntries = [];   menuEntries.push({name: "Go to sheet...", functionName: "showGoToSheet"});   ss.addMenu("Tasks", menuEntries); }  function showGoToSheet() {   var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();   var allsheets = ss.getSheets();   var app = UiApp.createApplication();   app.setTitle("Go to sheet...").setWidth(800).setHeight(600);   var table = app.createFlexTable();   table.setCellPadding(5).setCellSpacing(0);   var goToSheetClick = app.createServerHandler('handleGoToSheetClick');   var widgets = [];   for (var i = 0; i &lt; allsheets.length; i++) {     var sheet_name = allsheets[i].getName();     widgets[i] = app.createHTML(sheet_name).setId(sheet_name).addClickHandler(goToSheetClick);     table.setWidget(i, 1, widgets[i])   }   var panel = app.createSimplePanel();   panel.add(table);   app.add(panel);   ss.show(app); }  function handleGoToSheetClick(e) {   var sheet_name = e.parameter.source;   var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();   var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(sheet_name);   sheet.activate();   var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication();   app.close();   return app; }  Save the script, then refresh the spreadsheet. After a second or two a new menu, Tasks , will appear after Help . There is one item in this menu: Go to sheet...   This menu item will open a panel with a list of names of all the sheets in the current spreadsheet. It doesn't look like it, but if you click on one of the sheet names, that sheet will come to the front.   As an answer to another question, this script was improved to include a scrollable view and buttons.      
</answer>
<answer>
   The best way to do this from my experience is to tie a function to a button/image. The only drawback is that you cannot pass parameters along with a script assigned to a button. Due to this you will need to make a function specific to each navigation but they can call be a in a single script file.  Steps:  Create an image (Insert -&gt; image) and style it to your preference  Create a custom function with the following:  function showSheetByName(Name) {    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();    var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(Name);    SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(sheet); }  and then a function specific to your button  function showSheet5() {    showSheetByName("Sheet5"); }  Finally assign this function to your button  Assign Script... showSheet5  You should now be able to click on your button and navigate to "Sheet5". This can also be modified to go to a specific area of the sheet as well.

   I put together a redirect for searching just 'back n days' that does the simple (and for me, most common use case)  Writing a search for ‘inbox NOT including today’ is slightly counterintuitive and somewhat of a pain so I put together a custom redirect of my own that brings up the stuff from yesterday:  http://joereddington.com/back/0   That redirects you to your inbox with a custom search string, showing only those emails that turned up before today. It’s parameterisable so  http://joereddington.com/back/4   takes you back four days and  http://joereddington.com/back/10   takes you back ten days  Code, screenshots, and reasoning are all at http://joereddington.com/4008/2014/08/04/gmail-for-yesterdays-jobs/

   Side note: If you are leaving a comment on the video you can't use the full link (Youtube bans all links in comments), but you can use a simple "mm:ss" format in your comment on Youtube to automatically create a link to that point in the video . I haven't seen this documented anywhere but it comes in handy for quick links. Also it uses Javascript instead of the #t= anchor so you can make multiple time references and click on them really fast to create quick mash-ups or loop the video at a specific point.

   A document can potentially be in multiple folders, but you can get a list of them through the UI.   First, click the folder icon next to the document title:  This will open a list of the folders that the current document is in:   You can click the folder name from that list to go to the main Drive listing for that folder, or click the Organize button to move the document to another folder.       
</answer>
<answer>
   Let's provide a means to go to the document's parent folder with a click of the mouse.  Place the script below in your document's 'container-bound' script editor. Do this by opening your document and then from the document menu bar, select Tools &gt; Script editor...  If this is your first time editing that document's script, default code will populate the editor's screen. Simply replace the script content with the code below. Include both the function onOpen() and listParentFolders() listed below.  Save the script in the editor and then 'refresh' the browse window displaying the associated document. A new menu item will appear for the document named Utils. Clicking on the Utils Menu pad will display the menu popup, Show Path. This script will display the directory path as a list of hyperlinks.  function onOpen() {     // Add a menu with some items, some separators, and a sub-menu.   DocumentApp.getUi().createMenu('Utils')       .addItem('Show Path', 'listParentFolders')       .addToUi(); }     function listParentFolders() {    var theDocument = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();    var docID = theDocument.getId();    var theFile = DocsList.getFileById(docID);    var parents = theFile.getParents();    // No folders   if ( parents == null ) return;    var folder = parents[0];    var folderName = folder.getName();    var folderURL = folder.getUrl();    var folders = [[folderName,folderURL]];    while (folderName != "Root"){       parents = folder.getParents();       folder = parents[0];       folderName = folder.getName();       folderURL = folder.getUrl();       folders.unshift([folderName,folderURL]);   }    var app = UiApp.createApplication().setTitle("Folder Hierarchy").setHeight(250).setWidth(300);    var grid = app.createGrid(folders.length, 1).setStyleAttribute(0, 0, "width", "300px").setCellPadding(5);    var indentNum = 0, link;    for (var fldCntr = 0; fldCntr &lt; folders.length; fldCntr++){       folderName = folders[fldCntr][0];       folderURL = folders[fldCntr][1];       link = app.createAnchor(folderName, folderURL).setId("id_" + fldCntr).setStyleAttribute("font-size", "10px");       grid.setWidget(indentNum, 0, link);       indentNum += 1;   }    app.add(grid);    DocumentApp.getUi().showSidebar(app); }

   As of 2014-04-04, there are a couple of ways to get from a document to its containing folder.  From the open document, click the folder icon next to the document's title. A dialog appears with "This item is in" and the containing folder name. The folder name is linked to the folder.If a "Move to" dialog appears instead, the document's containing folder is the root. If it's your document or or you've explicitly added it, it's in My Drive. If not, try More &gt; All Items in the folder list at the left of the document list view.  From the document search view, select the item. More &gt; Details and activity &gt; Details &gt; Folders. Any folder names listed are linked to the corresponding folders.

   AFAIK no, there is no way to do this from the document URL or the document itself. You'd need to grab the title of the doc and search for it in your Drive list view. The search results should show you the document title, then also show the name of the parent folder in gray.

   Here is a more complete and reliable implementation of the two scripts in these answers ( first one and second one ) to this question.  This script allows you to paste the full URL of the file or the file ID into the first edit box in the dialog and then returns a text representation of the path as well as a link to the parent directory.  The installation instructions are identical to what is shown above by Jacob , I copied them below for completeness.  NOTE: Some of the APIs used in all of these scripts are now obsolete.  They are still working as of when this post was made, but will probably stop working in the future.  // // Take a Google Drive file URL or ID and output a string representation of the path as well as a link // to the parent folder // // Based on http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/43881/how-to-view-the-parent-folder-of-a-google-document  function doGet() {   // create app and grid   var app = UiApp.createApplication();    var grid = app.createGrid(5,2);        // set labels for first column   grid.setWidget(1, 0, app.createLabel("URL or file ID: ").setStyleAttribute('fontWeight', 'bold'));   grid.setWidget(2, 0, app.createLabel("Folder Path: ").setStyleAttribute('fontWeight', 'bold'));   grid.setWidget(3, 0, app.createLabel("Folder URL: ").setStyleAttribute('fontWeight', 'bold'));    // set text boxes for second column   grid.setWidget(1, 1, app.createTextBox().setId("key").setName("key").setWidth(1000));   grid.setWidget(2, 1, app.createTextBox().setId("path").setName("path").setWidth(1000));   grid.setWidget(3, 1, app.createAnchor("","").setId("url").setName("url").setWidth(1000));    // create button and handler   grid.setWidget(4, 0, app.createSubmitButton("Find")     .addClickHandler(app.createServerHandler("listParentFolders")     .addCallbackElement(grid)));    // add grid to application and show app   app.add(grid);   return app; }  // // getIdFromUrl - Get the file id portion of the url.

   It's now a baked in feature under the GitHub Traffic section .   You can now see detailed analytics data for repositories that you're an owner of or that you can push to. Just load up the graphs page for your particular repository and you'll see a new link to the traffic page.   The old method used to be some hack like adding an image or similar web bug to your README file.  When someone comes across your repo, provided your README has an extension that GitHub will automatically render , then it should also load the image. And that should, depending on how the web bug is set up, give you some detail or clue as to the source of traffic.  Or you could appeal via contact to the GitHub Supportocats and see if they're willing to give you a heads up on the incoming source of the sauce.

Search in Gmail - How to search the mails without reply?
</question>
<answer>
   I don't know of a direct way to do this, but you can create a filter that marks any mail containing " Re: " with a specific label (lets say RE ), and the search for -{label:RE}  alternatively, skip the labeling part and search for -{"re:"}      
</answer>
<answer>
   I wanted to move all the mails I had sent to people and had not received a reply, into a label in Gmail. After trying different queries for an hour, I realised multiple queries would do the trick. And this worked for me.  1. Search for   in:inbox to:me category:personal   Select all conversations that match this search, and Label as: Create new Label → Replied  2. Search for   in:inbox from:me -label:replied   Select all conversations that match this search, and Label as: Create new Label → NoReplyPlusChats  3. Search for   label:NoReplyPlusChats is:chats   Select all conversations that match this search, and Remove Label NoReplyPlusChats → Apply  4. Rename Label NoReplyPlusChats to NoReply  5. Delete Label Replied  Now all your un-replied mails have the label: NoReply  ( NOTE: Label NoReply would still contain your synced notes from smartphones, Apple Notes etc.)      
</answer>
<answer>
   I decided to use this search operator:  from:me -subject:"re:" -is:chats -is:draft -has:userlabels  It's not perfect, but it cuts down on a lot of the conversations.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Just a few years late, but I wrote a Gmail plugin to help with this. It's been pretty popular so far and is probably used by thousands of people by now. You can find instructions for it here: http://jonathan-kim.com/2013/gmail-no-response/  It does a more sophisticated look up of who hasn't replied to your email, and you can tweak it to be even more effective to your use case.      
</answer>
<answer>
   None of the previous answers worked for me. Searching for -subject:re and equivalents seem to match EVERY conversation. I believe this is because that search is positive for the first message in the conversation (which does not have "Re:" in the subject line).  What works for me is:   Create a label (I called it "HasReply") using the filter: subject:(+re)  Then search for -label:hasreply or -label:hasreply -from:me   The logic here is that the first search will find all of the conversations with a reply. The second will then exclude those - leaving the messages without replies.  Adding the -from:me addresses a corner case where I'm searching a bunch of emails, sent NOT from me, to multiple recipients, and I want to find the ones NOBODY has replied to. Without the -from:me the results will for some reason include conversations where I am the only person who has replied. Adding this would not be appropriate in answering the original question, where the person wanted to find emails he had sent (which this would exclude) and had not received a reply to.  Alas, it is still not perfect. I create and apply the filter ("to matching conversations") and all is good. Then new replies come in and they don't seem to be added to the label...so I have to go back in like I'm editing the filter and re-apply it to catch the latest messages.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Based on Ophir’s answer (I'm not sure if it’s possible to merge answers—I'm sure someone will pop along if neccessarily).  Filter for -subject:"re:" as mentioned—I labeled all such messages reply. (Has to be a filter because you want to label the thread not the reply.)  The search string I then had to use was:  -label:reply (from:myEmail OR from:myOtherEmail) -(variousKeyWordsThatSpecifySelfMails OR ect) -(to:myEmail OR to:myEmail)  Also—I'm afraid I'm not quite answering the OP—this will find all single emails that didn't get a reply. If someone emailed me, and I emailed back, and then there was no reply—that won't be found...

   Yes, just click in Join this group and choose your preferences. Then you're set  Edit: I'm sorry I've misread your question.  You could try this trick, paste in your browser URL bar:   http://groups.google.com/group/mojolicious/boxsubscribe?email=myid   Replace 'mojolicious' with the name of the group you want to join, and replace myid with the email address you want to use. You should get a confirmation email (I've just tried it and it works with hotmail)

   Procedure to join Google Groups without creating a Google account:   Look for group email address in the heading of “Group email”, it will look like: Group email (Group Name)@googlegroups.com or visit the group web page on Google Groups, and click on “About this group”.  Send an email to (Group Name)+subscribe@googlegroups.com . +subscribe is the key, which is appended to the end of group’s email address. (Group Name) is the name of the group. Space is substituted by “-” (hyphen).   Source . (gone)  Note: You should send the subscribing email from the email address which you want to receive the messages mailing. You may need to confirm the subscription request for some groups.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Currently you can join at this URL:  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/&lt;groupname&gt;/join  To leave the group, you can use  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/&lt;groupname&gt;/unsubscribe      
</answer>
<answer>
   The most generic solution which should work for every address/mail provider and every Google group is send a mail to  [Group Name]+subscribe@googlegroups.com  [ http://www.mydigitallife.info/how-to-subscribe-or-join-google-groups-without-google-account/ ]  Some Groups seem to be restricted to mails registered to the Google account. An example is the orient-database group - visiting  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/orient-database/join  won't let you choose an arbitrary address. I could only add one alternative address besides my Gmail address, so adding addresses to the Google account isn't a solution.  EDIT 1: The secret is that one can subscribe to any google mailing address with an address unknown to google when logged out (the first time you log out, google logs you in, just be insistent)      
</answer>
<answer>
   If all else fails, you could try writing to the group owners, at https://groups.google.com/d/contactowner/mojolicious (modify as appropriate), if the group owners have enabled that option.      
</answer>
<answer>
   As you can subscribe to the mailing list using your Google Account, and therefore get these mails sent to your address associated with the Google account, you should be able to forward these messages by filtering the appropriate message subjects and sending these to the account you have outside of Google mail. If you look at the actual sender of these Google groups mails, you might be able to figure out a general rule for your filters, so you won't have to set a filter for every mail. It should work as a fine workaround imho.

   As of the date of this post, Google Drive does not support searching within a specific folder. However, the new Docs, Sheets, and Slides home screens do have a way to let you do this via the File Picker search interface:   Go to: https://docs.google.com  Click the File Picker folder icon on the right side of screen.  Navigate to the specific folder that you want to search.  Now put your query term in the file picker's search box and hit 'Enter' (Or click the 'Search for all items containing ')   Your search results will only come from the folder you selected.  Note: you can still filter by file type in the File Picker search bar by clicking the drop down arrow.

It asks you to share a scary bunch of permissions, so you may want to look at the code at https://github.com/ljv5555/drive-folder-search/tree/gh-pages/app to reassure yourself, and possibly make your own copy.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I don't think there is such a feature available in Google Drive yet, but you can do a workaround.  If you do not intend to search for files recursively, simply just open the folder you want to search in and use the browser function ( Ctrl + F ) to search the name of your desired file.  Of course using this method you can't search within the file itself for text matches.      
</answer>

For example, if you search and press Enter in Sheets, only Google Sheets results will show up in your home screen.  Find other file formats  You can quickly find your other files, for example your .doc, .pdf, and .xls files, from the home screens by using the file picker. The file picker allows you to browse your Google Drive files and folders and open up any file you're looking for.  Go to any of the Docs, Sheets, or Slides home screens. Click the File picker icon  in the top right. Search within your files and folders until you find the file you’re looking for. Click Select and the file will open in a new tab.

So, please, still go ahead and bother Google Team :  In the past, we could go and suggest it as a feature . But right now, best way to do it is going on the Settings Wheel -&gt; Help -&gt; Send Feedback   Do every kind of feedback, and maybe one day we'll have it... After all, who knows until when this hack will work! Maybe this hack is their initial attempt to implement it at last.

<answer>
   Note: @Joe has created a JavaScript bookmarklet which automates the process described below. It is available at joereddington.com-&gt;better-gmail-search .  I discovered this slightly more friendly hack after noticing the URL of the inbox: unread first . After expanding the unread section, you'll notice in the location bar there's a #section_query . With the exception of that one part, it's practically the same as a search result URL.  So, the solution is to first input the search terms and search. Then, in the address bar, replace #search with #section_query .  This will provide you with a search page with the same amount of pages as specified in your settings, without the hassle of creating a filter.

   This seems like a poor-mans hack -   do a search as normal to get an initial list of messages you want to 'review'. select the search dropdown at the end of the search field and click 'Create filter with this search &gt;&gt;'  Select checkbox 'Apply the label' and pick a new label for it (such as 'review' or named after something in your search query).  If this is a new label, select 'Create'  Select checkbox 'Also apply filter to NNN matching conversations'  Click 'Create filter'.  You should see a message 'Your filter was created'  Now on the leftside bar look for your new label (you may have to open the 'More' link to see all the labels available)  click on the label you chose above.   Now you get as many lines as your gmail 'Maximum page size' settings  allow (100 in my case).  WARNING: this filter is still in place, so incoming messages that match will be tagged with this new label ('review' in my example above).  You can leave it in place or delete it once you are done reviewing various searched for items.      
</answer>
<answer>
    Search for the messages you want to delete by title. When they come up, at the top of the results box will appear this message:   All 20 conversations on this page are selected.   Right next to that appears: "Select all conversations that match this search". Click that and it will grab all of them.  Then when you hit "Delete" you will be prompted by a pop-up that says:   This action will affect all conversations in this search. Are you sure you want to continue?   Hit OK and they will all be gone.       
</answer>
<answer>
   See http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=53dcd356f1981203 :  You might have found this already, but immediately after clicking on settings up in the right hand corner of the page, you will see on the second option, Maximum page size, which you can change to 25, 50, or 100.  HOWEVER, this does not apply when you Searches or Filter you email.  It defaults to 20 messages again.  It's an elementary fix which I hope they fix soon.

How can I back up all emails stored in my Gmail account?
</question>
<answer>
   The most simple way to do this is activating pop3 or IMAP in your "Mail Settings" and retrieving the email using your own client (Thunderbird, Outlook, etc.).      
</answer>
<answer>
   One way is to log in using a mail client that supports IMAP . You can then export the emails to a backup location, but this is a bit laborious.  If you want a continuous backup, you could try something like imapsync . This would require you to run your own backup IMAP server and schedule a regular task to perform the synchronisation.  Edit : Preserving labels should work fine, but not quite in the way that Gmail handles them. I've not seen any IMAP or POP3 servers which handle the Gmail label system properly. Gmail presents each tag as a separate folder through IMAP, so as far as the user is concerned, the message exists in several places. (In fact, the inbox is just another label). If you synchronise your account to another IMAP server, you will essentially have multiple copies of the same message.

   Gmail backups have become a somewhat timely topic, as thousands of Gmail users had their account reseted by accident recently.  Here's one more backup solution from the comments to that Engadget post:   I have all my GMail emails forwarded to my Hotmail account, of which all of the emails are downloaded locally on 2 different computers. I've had my Hotmail account since 1998, and I've never lost anything or had a problem so if GMail goes down, Hotmail will still work, and if that goes down, I have it all backed up.   Hopefully with this bump, we'll get even more good, up-to-date answers to the question. (At least gmail-backup.com, mentioned in the accepted answer , now seems defunct.)      
</answer>
<answer>
   I'm kind of find of IMAPSize . It's not the most fully-featured tool you'll ever find, but it backs things up in the most open way possible: each message in it's own file, which could easily be imported into any other e-mail client. It also includes an option for restoring from a backup (though I've never tested that).  Be careful when using IMAP mail clients for backups: I lost some mail at one point because I had thought Thunderbird was keeping local copies of things that it had decided it didn't need to keep. This was a config error on my part, but it's a warning to be careful.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Theoretically speaking, you can open up another gmail account and use it to pop your mail from the first account.  You can chain this to have many different gmail accounts backing your mail up.  If you automatically label your messages, then you can redefine the filters in each account so that labels continue to apply.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I developed Gmail Keeper for this. Why I've done that when there are other tools out there? Because I need to backup multiple Gmail accounts on a regular basis, and I don't want to input the login info each time when I need to make a backup .  Both emails and labels will be backed up to local disk in standard file formats (eml and zip). It can also backup the Gmail chat logs if you enable the 'Chats' folder access in the advance IMAP settings in Gmail. However, It's for Windows only.

YouTube stops buffering when video is paused
</question>
<answer>
   It seems to be on a video by video basis. Your 'create a spaceship' tutorial will buffer when paused, but your 'create a city' tutorial will not.  They seem to use slightly different players; based on the right-click menus.  The spaceship tutorial mentions HTML5 and the city tutorial has the standard Flash menu.  You could try forcing the use of a different media player or you could try joining Youtube's HTML5 trial; the 'create a city' tutorial buffers fine when played using the HTML5 player.  https://www.youtube.com/html5  Edit to include solution by Andrew Price:   Login in to your YouTube account  In 'Settings' go to the 'Playback' menu  Under 'Video Playback Quality' check the 'I have a slow connection' option   This will default video output to 360p, but you can manually alter this when playing the video.  Even at higher definitions the video will continue to buffer.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I found a solution which is to change the resolution after buffering stops and return to the changed resolution. This way it will buffer till the end.

   Go to your All mail view ,  and click "Select all" (or the drop down option All from the checkbox far left of Archive | Spam | Delete buttons).  Underneath the | Archive | Spam | Delete | + | - | Move to Inbox | Labels | More | buttons...  You'll see a message appear in a yellow bar that says:   All 100 conversations on this page are selected. Select all 73795 conversations in All Mail   Click on the "Select all conversations" link on the right side of the message, then click delete.  The actual deletion process may take a very, very long time, during which you will be unable to use Gmail or log in (don't worry, it's still churning away in the background, even if it gives you an error!)  When it's done, all conversations (except spam) will be in the trash and you should see a message that says "You don't have any mail! Our servers are feeling unloved."  Now just empty the trash and delete all spam, and your account is now empty.

How can I send a Windows executable via Gmail?
</question>
<answer>
   Rename your file to something like example.exe_ and try again.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Most if not all of the methods for sending large files work for this as well, especially if the recipient is not too tech-savy, as it doesn't require renaming a file extension or downloading an alternate archive application.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Zip it up using Winrar or 7zip.  Gmail understands .zip format but not .rar and .7z .      
</answer>
<answer>
   Changing file extension is OK as long as it is like *.zip1 or *.cnvrt . But, we should never change it to *.png or *.doc because the recipient might have known extension hidden (under Folder Options) and downloaded file will be associated with default application. If s/he is not tech-savvy, you might have to put extra effort to tell the person to turn that setting off so that the file could be made viewable by intended application.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Zip it up with a password (using, say, WinZip or 7Zip).      
</answer>
<answer>
   As others have mentioned if an executable is in a zip archive the Gmail scanner will still find it and stop you sending it. However if you bzip2 the zip it goes through OK. This could also slightly reduce the zip size.  This obviously requires platforms that support bzip2 on both ends. I took this route on a linux machine where there was no .exe extension to rename.      
</answer>
<answer>
   This is more useful for when you specifically want to send it to someone who is not technically inclined (i.e. you want to make it dead-easy to open), which is why I originally posted it as an answer to this question , but it works!   "Add" your .exe file to a (new) encrypted .zip file (the "inner file".)  Change the file extension from .zip to .zipx .  (Of course, other extensions probably work.  You could even make the extension .thepasswordisHuckleberry !)  "Add" the .zipx file to a (new) unencrypted .zip file (the "outer file".)  E-mail the outer (.zip) file along with the password for the inner file.   That's it.  As an added bonus, you don't even have to change the file extension.  Windows File Explorer recognizes the inner (.zipx) file as a valid .zip file, so you can just double-click it and enter the password.  This is what it looks like after opening the outer file and trying to open the inner file.  Note the .zip icon on the .zipx file.  The text file is just there as an example of how you could keep the password conveniently attached to the file, since the point of it is just to get through GMail.

How do you handle dependencies between cards with Trello?
</question>
<answer>
   Trello does not have an official way to handle dependencies. The best thing to do is to have a "Waiting" list where you keep all the cards that are waiting on some other piece of work. If this becomes unmanageable, it's probably a sign that the board needs to be split up.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I've been wrestling with this too. The best solution I've found at this point is a checklist item to post a note on the dependent card. Manual process but it doesn't take that long and usually there is some communications that would help "passing the torch".  I've found by doing it this way it provides a prompt of what to do and and an automatic notification to the person assigned to the dependent card. No need to try and "train" anyone.

</answer>
<answer>
   Trello doesn't (currently) have a way to link items directly to each other.  The approach that works for me is to use a "waiting" -label on items that are stuck. This way they can maintain the context that their lists provide. And since items can have multiple labels it doesn't conflict with any existing labels either.  Of course, if your lists don't contain any context worth maintaining, a separate list for waiting items works well too.  For updating the state of the dependent card, I suggest Bob Snodgrass's answer of adding a checklist item for each prerequisite card, that says "Add note on dependent card X when complete". Or if you need further organization, you could even create a "Dependencies" -checklist on the dependent card with items for each prerequisite card. Then people completing the prerequisite card can just go mark their card as done.  The best feature of Trello is how it keeps all the features simple - so that's probably why there's no dependency, since it would make things more complicate. That said, I think a feature to link items (if kept simple and clear) would be a wonderful addition, as it is a basic element of keeping work organized.      
</answer>
<answer>
   One option to address dependencies that I've started using is leveraging the convert task to card and card link functions.  This expands on Ilari Kajaste's answer.  For example:   Create the parent card  Create a task list on the parent card - these tasks will become the child cards  Convert the tasks to cards (Click on the task to enter edit mode, click "Convert to Card" link  A new card will be created (using the same title as the converted task), and in it's activity notes will be a link back to the parent card.  I copy this link into the description or into a new checklist task for transparency - the original link may eventually be buried under later activity notes.  To tie child back to parent, click the "More" link at the bottom right hand corner of the child card and copy the shortcut link from the "Link to this Card" field  Navigate back to the parent card via the link in the activity notes (or closing the card and navigating manually) and add the child card link in the parent description, task list or other convenient place.   The owner of the parent card can check off the dependent tasks as they are completed.  This is straight forward using the links added in the last point above. Alternatively, the owner of one of the child cards can have a final task to navigate back to the parent card and check off the initial task.  A nice feature of this process is that if these child cards are later moved to another board, the links persist.  The product owner can create the relationships on a planning board, move cards willy nilly and still have easy access to and from those cards where ever they land.  Even if the manual copying / pasting of links is not completed, there will always be at least this one artifact of the original parentage in the child card.  The downside is there is at least one manual step (copying child card link to parent card) to create a solid relationship, but overall is a good alternative to the more management heavy processes such as maintaining separate "waiting" lists and describing the dependent cards.      
</answer>
<answer>
   We have written a "Links" addon for Trello that adds JIRA-like dependencies - with various types like "depends on" or "blocks".

   The following conditions must be met:   The subject must be similar (e.g. test and re: test will work; but test and test 123 won't).  The sender must be a part of the thread OR the in-reply-to header must be used.   The in-reply-to header can be used via Gmail's interface by simply replying to the thread. This is what enables forwarded messages to be a part of the same thread even though the sender is different.

<answer>
   Trello doesn't have a predefined way to mark a card as done, but you could certainly name a label "Done" and apply it to cards that you have completed.      
</answer>
<answer>
   If a card has a due date, placing in a different list or changing the label won't disable alerts as the date approaches and passes.  Removing the date is a workaround, but one that obviously prevents future analysis on actual vs. target dates.  An ideal solution would provide the desired status and disable due date notifications.

   I too like to have due dates acknowledged and see in my lists which tasks have been completed and which are still left to do.  I quickly worked out that this was not going to be possible in Trello.  So I have created a Completed Tasks list, and when I transfer a completed task to this list I change the due date to the date I completed the task.  Not ideal, but it does help me with tracking how many tasks I get through each day. Because I also use the labels, I can see how many tasks in each group I get through each day.  Maybe in future editions of Trello this element might be improved.

Get e-mail addresses from Gmail messages received
</question>
<answer>
   I am quite surprised of all the complicated answers implying some extra tools! Every email you receive has its address added to "All contacts" (as opposed to "My Contacts") in the Contacts part of Gmail. Export that one and you're done (or I missed something in your question).

   This is where the power of Google Apps Script kicks in. If you paste the following script in a new Google Spreadsheet (Tools, Script editor, press the bug icon to authenticate the script), then new sheets will be automatically created based on the number of labels present. After that, the e-mail addresses will be added.  function getEmails() {   // set spreadsheet and retrieve labels   var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();     var labels = GmailApp.getUserLabels(), emptyLabels = [];    // itterate through the labels   for (var i=0; i&lt;labels.length; i++) {      try {       // create sheets and clear content       var sh = ss.getSheetByName(labels[i].getName()) ||        ss.insertSheet(labels[i].getName(), ss.getSheets().length);       sh.clear();        // get all messages       var eMails = GmailApp.getMessagesForThreads(         GmailApp.search("label:" + labels[i].getName()))           .reduce(function(a, b) {return a.concat(b);})           .map(function(eMails) {         return eMails.getFrom()        });        // sort and filter for unique entries         var aEmails = eMails.sort().filter(function(el,j,a)         {if(j==a.indexOf(el))return 1;return 0});          // create 2D-array       var aUnique = new Array();         for(var k in aEmails) {         aUnique.push([aEmails[k]]);       }        // add data to corresponding sheet       sh.getRange(1, 1, aUnique.length, 1).setValues(aUnique);     } catch (e) {       emptyLabels.push(labels[i].getName());     }    }    ss.toast("These sheets are empty: " + emptyLabels); }  Use the SPLIT function to extract names to find duplicates. System folders are ignored, like INBOX or All Items .  Note: script might take some time to execute, which is of course dependent upon the amount of e-mails

   I did quite a bit of searching for an app that works at label level and found Gmail Email Exporter from Star Banana .  It's a paid app (I have nothing to do with them) but it's cheap and you get to export email addresses from specific labels or all your Gmail account.  So in your case put all your email received into a label using a filter and use the above to export to a CSV file.

   The only way to do this is   Export all as .txt (see: Export Gmail messages to text or HTML files )  Loop through all of it and grep "From: " lines in a seperate database.   Note: if you use imapsize (free) for step 1 then save the backups as "%FROM - The sender of the email" and you have them in plain sight in your directory.

    Navigate to the list. Choose the checkbox option dropdown, and select all.  [At the top you will get a hyperlink option to choose all conversations in your list. Click it.] Update: This step doesn't work, it will only let you do 25 at a time, bummer!  Then go under the More dropdown and choose filter messages like these.  In the filter dialogue the From textbox will be highlighted. These are all the from addresses.  Copy it.  Paste it in to an HTML editor like Notepad++ or Visual Studio.  Now you just need to do a search and replace of the word OR, replace with ; or , .  Recopy the list and paste into your  message.

   Based off of @jacob-jan-tuinstra's answer. Made some minor modifications to suit my needs perhaps others would find it useful.  Uses search, doesn't break up by labels and also does chunking for large inboxes.  The part that says 'YOUR GMAIL SEARCH QUERY GOES HERE' can be filled with any query you would use in your inbox.  function getEmails() {   // set spreadsheet and retrieve labels   var query = 'YOUR GMAIL SEARCH QUERY GOES HERE',     ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(),     sh = ss.getSheetByName(query) || ss.insertSheet(query, ss.getSheets().length),     uniqueEmails = {},     errors = [],     // max chunk size     chunkSize = 500,     currentChunk = 0,     threads,     messages,     i,     j,     k,     msg,     tos;   sh.clear();   while (currentChunk === 0 || threads.length === chunkSize) {     try {       // grab threads that match the query one chunk at a time       threads = GmailApp.search(query, chunkSize * currentChunk, chunkSize);       // grab corresponding messages from the threads       messages = GmailApp.getMessagesForThreads(threads);       for (i = 0; i &lt; messages.length; i++) {         msg = messages[i];         for (j = 0; j &lt; msg.length; j++) {           // get the from           uniqueEmails[msg[j].getFrom()] = true;           // get the reply to           uniqueEmails[msg[j].getReplyTo()] = true;           // grab from the to field as well           // this has a bug for people with commas in their names           // tos = msg[j].getTo().split(',');           // for (k = 0; k &lt; tos.length; k++) {           //  uniqueEmails[tos[k]] = true;           // }         }       }       currentChunk += 1;     } catch (e) {       errors.push(e);     }   }   // create 2D-array   var aUnique = [];   for (k in uniqueEmails) {     aUnique.push([k]);   }    // add data to corresponding sheet   sh.getRange(1, 1, aUnique.length, 1).setValues(aUnique); }

   I figured out a way to do this for Mac users using Mac Mail and address book without needing to download extra software. This works with Mac Mail 4.6 and Address Book 5.0.3. Not sure if it works for other vers or not. This may work similarly for other IMAP Email programs like Thunderbird, but I can't vouch for that.  Here are the steps:   Set up your Gmail account in Mac Mail. Make sure the incoming mail server is "imap.gmail.com" You can find this under the toolbar&gt;Mail&gt;Preferences&gt;Accounts.  In Gmail, create a Label for the emails for which you want to extract email addresses.  In Gmail, label all the emails you want per Label above.  In Gmail, go to Settings&gt;Labels and tick off the the box for the new Label you created that says "Show in IMAP."  Restart Mac Mail so the new Gmail Label syncs.  Open Address Book. If you use Address Book for your contacts you'll need to back up your contacts because you need to delete all contacts in Address Book. I believe you can do this with File&gt;Export&gt;Address Book Archive. I don't use Address Book other than for exporting Gmail emails so I can't give good advice on this. Delete Address Book contacts at your own risk.  In Address Book, delete all your contacts. You should be able to do this by selecting one contact, pressing Command+a and pressing the delete key.  In Mac Mail, find your IMAP folder. There should be a column on the left side of the window with all your Mailboxes. If not go to the top toolbar, select View&gt;Show Mailboxes or press Command+Shift+M. The IMAP folder will be toward the bottom of the column below "Reminders", "RSS", "On My Mac" etc. You should see the Name of your Gmail account you set up earlier with a dropdown arrow on the left.  In Mac Mail, click the dropdown arrow next to your mailbox. This will show you a list of folders and should show the Label you created in Gmail as a folder. Select this folder by clicking it.  In Mac Mail in the Messages window )which should now display all your emails for you Gmail Label), select all the emails in the list. Go to the top toolbar, select Messages&gt;Add Senders to Address Book or press Shift+Command+Y. All the senders for your Gmail Label should now be in Address Book.  In Address Book you can now export contacts as vCards to use in whatever program you like by going to the toolbar and selecting File&gt;Export&gt;Export vCards. You can even import back into Google Contacts. If you need a CSV file, unfortunately you will need to import the vCards into another program (Google Contacts works) and re-export because you cannot export CSV from Mac Mail.   Hope this helps! It's a bit cumbersome, but works for me and is pretty easy after you do it a couple of times.

How can I set a Gmail filter that finds email sent “only to me”?
</question>
<answer>
   To search for email sent only to you and not to a mailing list, for example, you have to add the following to the search box (and then you can create a filter using that search; there is a link in the expanded search box that says "Create filter &gt;&gt;" or something):  To:me AND -*  This means it'll search for email sent to "me" (that's you) and not to everybody else (including you) (that's * ), but the first part (i.e., To:me ) overrides that.      
</answer>
<answer>
   When creating the filter, can you put your email address in the from field and in the to field. I just tried this and it only includes emails that I've sent to myself.

   This new answer works if one of the other recipients has a top level domain that is common-ish and different from yours.  Aaron's answer appears not to work, for two reasons.  The first is that google does not implement wild cards in gmail ( Wildcard search in Gmail ). The second reason is that, from experience, I find the search considers BOTH conjuncts, to:me and, say, -to:com .  It's easy to check by entering to:me -to:com in the search bar, and finding that nothing sent to your gmail.com address is there.  From the question I linked above we know that you need to search tokens; e.g., top level domains like .com and .org. But we know we can't just do  to:me to:(-com -org -edu -gov -uk -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  As an aside, don't try and putting ALL top level domains in, as the search will be rejected for length.  I got the above list from This blog post about common TLDs .  There is one more thing to deal with, and that is the empty to: field.  My work around is to use is:important to limit the intrusion of these.  Gmail complained when I tried to make a filter with this flag, but it did properly filter a new (important) email to me.  So, we come to my answer, where my own top level domains are .com and .uk (.ac.uk, but the .uk is a token in itself):  is:important to:((-com OR me) -coop -org -edu -gov (-uk OR me) -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  This enforces the following two properties:  1. Emails to anyone with a listed domain different from yours are rejected  2. If an email has one of your domains, it must be (at least) to you.  In a similar manner, you can add specific email addresses that you commonly receive email together with you by adding something like -&lt;coworker@yourdomain.com&gt;

   Well...   Conversion : Students love to format their Documents (margins,borders,cover pages, advanced numbering, page breaks, section breaks) to their liking, it sucks if you are in group project and everyone else is using Word. It would be sad also if the professor sent you an assignment in .doc or .docx format and you lost information on the transfer.  Animations/Transitions in Presentations Maybe I am wrong/outdated but I have not seen that in Google Docs  Goal Seek : This is a life saver in Excel. If you are not packing Matlab or Mathematica then this is your saviour with non-linear equations   Other small features depend on what field and what courses but I assure you when you reach the upper levels even formatting stuff on Office for Mac is frowned upon. Do not even try googling for X vs Y it would not work, it is stuffed with tons of bloggers who do not even know how to make reset the line numbering by breaks :S . Also most likely your school would be in the MSDN Alliance which make Office software available in labs and classrooms.

   Isn't the "must always be connected to the internet" requirement of Google Docs a bit of an issue?  http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=176376   As of May 3rd, 2010 we’ve temporarily removed support for offline access in Google Docs through Gears. We know offline access is important for some of you, and we're working hard to bring a new and improved offline access option to Google Docs.  If you need offline access to certain documents after May 3rd, you can always export files to your computer from the Google Docs homepage, then upload your offline files back to Google Docs after you’re finished editing offline.   Personally, I'd rather have both options and use whatever I thought worked best. Why does it have to be either / or? Usually student Office licenses are so cheap as to be basically free...  http://www.microsoft.com/student/office/en-us/default.aspx

<answer>
   In my eyes, this really depends if you are taking any specialized classes.  If you intend to just use normal word processing, spread sheets, etc, Google Docs should suffice.  If, however, you intend on taking, for example, accounting classes, the professor may demonstrate specific procedures within Excel.  You may be able to replicate what he/she is doing with some thought, but it probably would not be worth the effort and all the googling, especially at the cost of the ability to follow along in class.

Create a Google maps link to a specific location
</question>
<answer>
   It's very straightforward. Just use the following link, changing the latitude and longitude for yours. The z is the zoom index, you can play with it to get where you want.  http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;ll=35.028028,-106.536655&amp;z=13  I got this information by clicking on the "Link" button in the right hand corner above a map. This will also allow you to get the latitude and longitude for a location.  I don't know of a good way to make a marker on Google Maps, through the UI anyway.  Right click on a point and select "What's Here?" to create a marker, but it will be to the closest thing (business, intersection, address, etc). This essentially performs a search with the latitude and longitude and returns whatever is closest to your search. A URL to do that would be:  http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.128061,-106.535561&amp;ll=35.126517,-106.535131&amp;z=17  With the q (for query I believe) being the coordinates where you want your marker.  A more effective method, if you are trying to send a link to a specific address would be to search for the address in Google Maps, which will give you a marker on the exact address and then use the "Link" button to get the URL for sharing.      
</answer>
<answer>
   as mentioned above, the link has to contain coordinates but can also contain description: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=description+(name)+%4046.090271,6.657248  In case you need to place multiple markers on the map, you will have to use some of the online tools, for example http://www.hamstermap.com and then choose QUICK MAP.

   Here's how I do it.   Install Google Maps Lab 's LatLng Marker for your Google Maps account  Search for a place &amp; use Drop LatLng Marker to any location you want.

Create the shared link by pasting the text as below http://maps.google.com/maps?z=18&amp;q= &lt;long/lat text here&gt;  E.g. http://maps.google.com/maps?z=18&amp;q=10.8061,106.7130   I don't see why it would be so difficult for the Google Maps Team add a Get Link button, hopefully it will be implemented in the future.

   To add a marker to a map, you can use the My Maps feature of Google Maps.  Follow the instructions in the link above to use My Maps. Add a marker for the location that you're interested in sharing, then click the Link button in the upper-right corner; that link can be used to bring someone directly to that location and will include the marker you placed there.

<question>
How can I make some data on a Google Spreadsheet auto-sorting?
</question>
<answer>
   You can use the sort() function for that, but you have to have your data in one place, and an automatically sorted copy of that data in another place.  For example, say I have Sheet1 with my data:  | A    | B    | C =====================  1 | This | this | 2  2 | Is   | is   | 1  3 | Test | test | 3  Then in Sheet2, cell A1, I would put this function:   =sort(Sheet1!A:C, 3, TRUE)   This would show my data, but sorted by column C (the third column), ascending.  | A    | B    | C =====================  1 | Is   | is   | 1  2 | This | this | 2  3 | Test | test | 3      
</answer>
<answer>
   It is also possible to use Google Apps Scripts to achieve automatic in-place sorting of the data.  This may be more difficult to achieve and more error-prone (I'd still go for William Jackson's solution, +1 BTW), but I thought it was interesting enough to show.  I have a sheet that looks like this:   I added a new script, using these steps:   in the menu, go to Tools -&gt; Script Editor...  select Create a new project  in the empty code window that appears, paste the following code, which will be run automatically whenever a cell is edited:  function onEdit(event){   var sheet = event.source.getActiveSheet();   var editedCell = sheet.getActiveCell();    var columnToSortBy = 4;   var tableRange = "B3:E9";    if(editedCell.getColumn() == columnToSortBy){        var range = sheet.getRange(tableRange);     range.sort( { column : columnToSortBy } );   } }  go back to the sheet and start playing around with the values to see the table sort automatically each time   Note:  In the above script,   the value 4 represents the index of column D (the Value column - the on that's going to be sorted)  the value "B3:E9" represents the table range (excluding the header row)   Your table will most likely differ from mine, so these values should be adjusted accordingly.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Here's a generic script that will autosort based on the 1st column, and assumes a Header row.  To create a script:   In the menu, go to Tools -&gt; Script Editor...   In the empty code window, paste the following code, which will run automatically whenever a cell is edited:  // LinkBack to this script:  // http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/7211/how-can-i-make-some-data-on-a-google-spreadsheet-auto-sorting/43036#43036   /**  * Automatically sorts the 1st column (not the header row) Ascending.  */ function onEdit(event){   var sheet = event.source.getActiveSheet();   var editedCell = sheet.getActiveCell();    var columnToSortBy = 1;   var tableRange = "A2:T99"; // What to sort.    if(editedCell.getColumn() == columnToSortBy){        var range = sheet.getRange(tableRange);     range.sort( { column : columnToSortBy, ascending: true } );   } }      
</answer>
<answer>
   Another option without a script is:  =QUERY(A1:C3,"SELECT * ORDER BY C")  The range is restricted (A1:C3) because where the order is ascending blank entries will appear first.

How can I find out when I subscribed to a YouTube channel?
</question>
<answer>
   Kind of a long way to do it but it was the only way I can find. I wanted to find out when I subscribed to someone, so to it I went to my YouTube channel and the first thing you see when you get there is your activity on YouTube. I knew the person I was searching for I was subscribed to for about a year so what I had to do was keep scrolling down until I found when I originally subscribed. As far as I saw it won't be an exact date so in my case it said a year, it could be anywhere from a year up to a year and 11 months. You still get an estimate of when you subscribed. Sorry for the long and vague answer, but it was all I could think of.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Yes, Just go their channel, hit the about tab, send them a message and it tells you it has been sent and when you subscribed.      
</answer>
<answer>
   This doesn't answer the question specifically, but it does help. Go to your channel on YouTube and scroll down until you see the section "Subscriptions." By clicking on the bold face text "Subscriptions" it will show you all of your subscriptions in vertical list with the channel you most recently subscribed to at the top, your second most recent sub below that,  etc. So at the end of that list will be the first channel you ever subscribed to. Unfortunately, none of those entries have a date on them :( That's all I have, sorry if it wasn't helpful, but, I hope what I provided was of some use.

   Dropbox supports sharing content across multiple accounts.   On the Dropbox website, using the account you wish to share from, create a new folder (e.g. "my project")  In the top toolbar, select "Invite to folder", enter the email addresses for the recipients (make sure it's the email they already use for their Dropbox account).  Each recipient will get an email asking if they wish to accept the share. When they do, the new folder (e.g. "my project") will appear and synch in their personal account.  The recipient can reorganise as they see fit.  just move the location of the folder in their account (say to move it into a "shared" folder or a "Projects for Matt" folder) - it won't affect anyone else who is sharing it (only changes to the contents of the folder will)

</answer>
<answer>
   You might setup a new account in the name of the project as a kind of 'master' account to keep the shared files under the control of the team, not any one individual, then using the web interface manage the folder sharing. This way the shared files will be synced to your account automatically (no need to mess with multiple desktop accounts).  But otherwise, as long as each user has there own account, I don't see any reason for extra accounts. Just select a folder to share and then add the users to begin sharing.      
</answer>
<answer>
   You can share folders with any number of people.  Right click any folder in your dropbox account, and choose "DropBox" and "Share this folder".  You'll be taken to a webpage where you can enter the email addresses of the people you need to share the folder with.  Everyone you're sharing with will need a dropbox account, but there's no need to create a separate "just for the project" dropbox account.

Multi user filter issue in Google Spreadsheets
</question>
<answer>
   Now Google Drive has a feature called “filter views”. It makes some filters available only to you while you don't change any data.   Use filter views in the new Google Sheets  In Google Sheets, filtering your data makes it easier for you to view and analyse data by letting you hide data that you want to temporarily take out of view. The new Google Sheets introduces filter views as well, which allow you to create, name, and save filters that you can use without disrupting how others are viewing your spreadsheet.  Creating a filter view  When you create a filter view, it’s like saving a filter that you can use over and over again.   Open the spreadsheet where you would like to create a filter view.  Click the Data menu, hover over “Filter views…” and select Create a new filter view. You can also click the down arrow to the right of the filter  icon and select Create a new filter view.  Using the down arrows in the column headers, sort and filter the data to fit your desired view. Your filter view will be saved as you make changes.  To close your new filter view, either click the X in the top-right corner of the spreadsheet or click the down arrow to the right of the filter  icon and select None.     (Note: If you had existing shared filter on columns first remove that.)  Source .

   Update:  The following is an answer from 2011. Obviously the right answer changed from that time as there is a better answer in 2014. Please note the 3 year difference before voting on the answer.  Keeping for archival reasons only, original answer:  I have checked the related Google Groups and Support threads. Obviously, it's not supported (and looks like no soon plan to be, although not 100% sure about this one).  The way I do now is export to Excel and apply the filter there, then find a likely unique value (or repeats few times) in the sheet to correlate the row in the Google Spreadsheet (by finding it in the Google sheet) and apply the required modifications. Not optimal, still hoping for per-user fllter support.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Same issue still exists. We are getting around it by creating separate sheets for each user that reference the main sheet, but with 'if then' logic applied to only show the info pertinent to that user. Other user's rows are programmed to appear as -----. That user's sheet is now a filtered duplicate of the main sheet that can then be filtered more as needed without messing up anyone else's view. We are now going to create another sheet that references the users' sheets, without pulling the ----- cells. The reason being that the users can now edit their sheets, and all changes will appear in the final sheet. It makes the main sheet a 'rough draft', and the final sheet the edited version. That's the plan anyway. . .

The reference management software will usually allow to copy the placeholder string for a chosen title to clipboard.  With all the placeholders entered into the document, export it as .rtf file.  Feed the .rtf file into the reference management software. Out will come a .rtf file with all the placeholders replaced by citations (in the style chosen) and a trailing list of citations.   ... or use WizFolio web service (http://wizfolio.com/)

How to analyze size of files in Dropbox
</question>
<answer>
   In the web interface click repeatedly the second column header, i.e. Type until it shows Size - then you will see the size of all the items in the current folder.      
</answer>
<answer>
   This is (currently) not possible using the web interface.  I'd recommend going through and deleting things you don't need in each folder, perhaps sorting them into folders such as "Keep", "Not Sure" then use selective sync with your PC to only sync the files you need. Though this is not very practical on the web interface as you cannot move around files by drag and drop. Downloading everything to your desktop is your best chance of sorting the files in your Dropbox.  Apart from traffic caps imposed by your ISP or limited local hard drive space I can't think of any reason why you would not download the whole thing and sort it there.  Of course you can always get one of your family or friends to accept an invite to join Dropbox from you to gain a 500mb bonus.

<answer>
   I highly recommend unclouded which is only for android phones. At the time of this writing it is a very new app but under my tests it worked perfectly(it's even, dare I say it, pretty beautiful) but to install it you have to join their group. There are really easy instructions at http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-unclouded-t2825327 , it takes only about one minute.  This does exactly what you are asking for, my only caveat(that the developer really couldn't fix) is that you are giving him permissions to all your files. I'm not super paranoid and he says he only takes the file names and sizes but it's something to consider. If you have unencrypted, personal files, I might not use it. But, really, you shouldn't be storing any important files in the plain anyway so it shouldn't be a problem :).      
</answer>
<answer>
   This is a lucky workaround.  On my Android mobile and tablet I use the app File Manager (Rhythm Software) which enables me to configure Dropbox (among other services) as a network drive (there are several other file managers that will do this). If I access Dropbox via File Manager I can select a folder as if it were on the mobile itself, click Details, and the app tells me the folder size and the number of files that are in it (not just the number of sub folders). The Dropbox mobile app itself won't do this, let alone the desktop version, as everyone has discovered.

   I've created a bookmarklet for this, using their exposed INLINE_JS.Browse.files :  javascript: (function() {   var kb = INLINE_JS.Browse.files.reduce(function(kb, file) {     return kb + file.bytes/1000;   }, 0);   var units = ['kb', 'mb', 'gb', 'tb'], unit = units.shift(), size = kb;   for (var i=0; i&lt;3; i++) {     if (size &lt; 1000) {       break;     }     size /= 1000;     unit = units.shift();   }   alert('Folder size: ' + (Math.round(size*1000)/1000) + ' ' + unit); })();  Copy it into a bookmark's URL and hit it.  You run it in a folder and it tells you the combined size of all files in that folder. It doesn't count subfolders and it doesn't work recursively. And it might break at any time, because their JS changes a lot.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Just click on one of the files into your folders, then move rapidly up or down with the arrow from keyboard. If you look at the top-right corner of the screen , at the end of the toolbar, you can see the size of each files.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Right-click on file and select Previous versions .  Now it will show you the file size !      
</answer>
<answer>
   The easiest way I know is if you have Dropbox synced with your desktop or laptop.  Go to Windows Explorer (My Computer) and go to the Dropbox library or folder on the computer and you can see folder sizes by right clicking and selecting properties.  Any changes or deletions you make will be reflected in the web client of Dropbox.

Add subtitles to a video of another user on YouTube
</question>
<answer>
   Currently you cannot add a subtitle/caption track to someone else's video.  However, you can prepare the caption/subtitle file for the video and then share it the author so they can add it to the video (it's simple and I don't think he or she would object since subtitles do not have to be turned on by default).  Since it will be in another language as the video's audio track (and not in English either) you will have to prepare a time-coded subtitle script (or caption file ). There are a number of articles about that available online including a good one to start with on Youtube help site.  Overall guidelines on preparing and adding subtitles to Youtube are available here .

<question>
Send urgent mail in Gmail
</question>
<answer>
   Interesting.  I tested by sending an email to my Gmail acct from an Exchange account, and setting the flag urgent.  Then I looked at the email in the web interface and from Outlook. In Outlook (getting Gmail) I saw the message flagged urgent. In the Web interface, I saw no urgent indication.  I replied to the message from the web interface and from Outlook. In the web interface, the urgent flag was not shown, and did not make it back to the Exchange account. In Outlook, the reply did not have the urgent flag activated, but when I activated it it was visible back on the Exchange account.  So, to summarize .. the Gmail web interface does not recognize the urgent flag, at least not as implemented by Microsoft Exchange. But the Gmail engine does not lose the header data when it is provided by another client.  As an aside .. I find the urgent flag far more irritation than it is worth.  Rarely does "urgent" to you mean that it should be "urgent" to me. When is the last time that you received a message flagged "low priority"?  IMHO it is far better to indicate in the subject and body that the issue is urgent or time-sensitive.  EDIT: Google just added (1-Sept-2010) the "Priority Inbox" functionality and some kind of importance measure. I will redo my tests and update.      
</answer>
<answer>
   It's not possible using the web interface.  I haven't tried with IMAP, but I assume it would honour an Urgent flag if set in your email client.

<answer>
   You can get an iCal link for your Upcoming Events (or Birthdays) that you can import into Google Calendar which will automatically stay up to date.  In Facebook:   Go to your Events  Go to the lower right portion of the page, where you'll see a message with two links:  Save the URL for the "Upcoming Events" link. (This will vary by browser/OS, but is generally something like right-click and "Copy link address")   The URL should be similar to:  webcal://www.facebook.com/ical/u.php?uid=999999999&amp;key=AbCDEf12345AAcd-f  (Your actual uid and key values will be different, of course.)  In Google Calendar:   Scroll down and open the "Other calendars" menu (on the left)  Choose "Add by URL"  Paste the webcal URL in the "URL" space then "Add Calendar"   You should now have a calendar "{Your Name}'s Facebook Events" listed under "Other Calendars" and can change the color, details, etc. as needed.

   Whilst it is possible to unlink other computers through the web interface, as slhck noted, this leaves all of your files where you don't want them. Depending on the sensitivity of your files (and how much work you want for yourself) you can:   Back up all Dropbox files locally  Delete any sensitive files from your Dropbox  Wait for the sync to remove these files from the remote computer  Unlink the offending computer(s) from https://www.dropbox.com/account#security  Return the backed-up files to your Dropbox for re-syncing   It might be worth leaving any other synced computers off (or disabling their syncs) during this process to avoid the sync deleting/restoring where unnecessary.

   Create a bookmark (insert -&gt; bookmark). Then you can add #name_of_bookmark to the end of the url.  eg:  http://docs.google.com/document/d/15xm3Bx4Elnjbg0VNY#name_of_bookmark      
</answer>
<answer>
   You can do the same thing with headers as you can with bookmarks without creating a Table of Contents.  Put the cursor on the header itself, then look at the address bar of your browser. It should change to update the fragment (hash - #) at the end like #heading=h.abc32def4 -- this should correspond to the link created in the Table of Contents. Copy that entire url and use wherever needed.  (from a similar question )   Update: the 'Insert Link' dialog now presents a list of headings, reducing the number of actions required:       
</answer>
<answer>
   After you've got the headings in the document and formatted as such, do Insert &gt; Table of Contents.  It will add a TOC to the document with clickable links.  Note that you can remove the TOC and the links are still valid.  You can also insert bookmarks rather than a TOC.  It isn't a search feature though.  If you look at the link that gets generated, it isn't something you'd be able to guess or manipulate.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Wanted to confirm that this works in Google Docs. Thanks so much for the answers in this thread.  What you do is highlight the portion you'd like to be linked in your document internally. Then, open up the "Insert" drop-down and click "Bookmark". That portion now will show up as an option when you want to link it elsewhere in the document. You can link it by clicking the link icon or going to "Insert" and clicking "link". In the options you should see "bookmarks" click it and then you can link it to the respective bookmark.  When you save the doc as a PDF those bookmarked links are now hyperlinked to where you want internally within the document.

Is there a way to join Google Hangouts without a Google+ account?
</question>
<answer>
   I'm not sure if this is a feature that has been introduced in the year since the question was asked, but it appears that you can use a limited version without a Google+ account via Gmail chat according to this support article :   If you don’t have a Google+ account you can start or join a limited hangout, which only includes the option to hang out with 1 other person. If you’d like access to all Hangouts’ features including the ability to hang out with up to 9 people, share your screen, and use cool Hangouts’ apps, you can upgrade to a free Google+ account   This sounds similar to what Korey has encountered and what Freedom tried to suggest.  This answer presumes you have GMail/Google account, but not a Google+ one. Unfortunately Google seem to be closing off their systems, highlighted by the discontinuation of XMPP support .

   It appears Hangouts on my Android phone works without a Google+ account, but many features such as photo sharing are disabled.  Hangouts for Chrome browser extension insists on creating a Google+ account.  Things could change.  I do not like how Google is pushing all users to Google+.      
</answer>
<answer>
   If you're concerned about your privacy, create a fake profile - name it something your friends would recognize or even the opposite of what your friends would recognize or random letters.  In the end, creating the profile isn't a big deal and it gets you better access to your friends: pretty good payoff.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I don't think so. You have to have a Google+ account to join hangouts!!  Update: But you can use a limited version. For more information John C's answer.

<question>
Where do my emails go when I click on 'Archive' in Gmail?
</question>
<answer>
   In the left pane there should be an "All Mail" option. If there isn't, expand the down arrow that should say something like "6 more" (see screenshot below), and click All Mail. Select them and you can move them back to the inbox if desired.       
</answer>
<answer>
   Archive removes the label inbox on your mail, without any other labels on the mail it's possible to find under All Mail or via search (as already said). I don't agree that they ' go to All Mail' as all (except Trash and Spam I think) mail is always there.      
</answer>
<answer>
   They go to All Mail. It should on the left side in the list under Compose Mail. Gmail changed some stuff around a while back so it might be hidden for you. If it is, click Settings (upper right corner), go to the Labels tab, and select which System labels you want to be displayed.      
</answer>
<answer>
   At Gmail emails aren't located at places. Mails have labels and you can search based on labels.  In this case you can either search for the mail in question or click on all mails.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Don't worry about where they are, just search for them.  And, if you've not done anything else since mistakenly clicking "Archive", there's a bar at the top saying   The conversation has been archived.  Learn more Undo    Click the "undo" link there  If you have keyboard shortcuts enabled, "/" takes you to the search box, "z" is for undo.

<question>
In Gmail, how can I find the oldest message from a person?
</question>
<answer>
   If you click "1-20 of [...]" you will see options to jump to the Newest or Oldest. The Oldest option isn't available if Gmail is still calculating the results so you may need to wait until the query finishes processing. Wait some time and hit the Older button to update the menu.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I just realized that I can narrow down the search results with more search operators.  Specifically, the before:1999/01/01 is very useful for this! I can set progressively older dates to reduce the results until I see what I need.      
</answer>
<answer>
   You can also run an advanced search for the specific person (in the From: field) and look at the last entry in the search results, assuming that you're looking for a message from a specific email address. Gmail displays its results in reverse chronological order by default.  Update  Found a workaround. It's a bit involved, but works. This solution takes advantage of Gmail labels, which currently still show the total number of emails that have been associated with each label.   Create a new filter that adds a label to all emails from the desired email (should be a new label)  Access the new label by clicking on Gmail's left hand menu area. URL should look something like https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#label/facebook  Note the number of emails available for this label  Assuming that your Gmail is set up to show 100 emails per page, let n = (# of emails)/100 and update your URL to show the n+1th page, e.g. https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#label/facebook/p38 for a label with 3738 emails/messages

<question>
How to hide my likes from my friends on Facebook?
</question>
<answer>
   The privacy of your like is dependent on the privacy of your friend's post. if they only share the post with you, then you liking it will only appear in your friend's activity feed/newsfeed.  If they share it with a group of friends it will appear only in that group of friends' activity feed/newsfeed.  If they share it publicly. It will end up in all your friend's activity feed/news feed      
</answer>
<answer>
   There is an option for this, but unfortunately you cannot set it; it must be set by your friends who do not want to see your comments and likes.  If you comment on or like a post that they can view, then your comment or like may appear in their News Feed unless they turn those off.  To do that they can hover their pointer over your name or go to your profile/timeline, then move to the Subscribed button, and uncheck "Comments and Likes".   Of course, they will still see your comments and likes on posts that they would see anyway in their News Feed, just not a separate story about them.      
</answer>
<answer>
   There could be no privacy setting that could help you - when we "like" something, we are actively making a public statement about something. If we don't want people to know we like something, we don't publish it on the web (i.e. don't touch that "like" button).  Otherwise mark4o has the best answer: if your friends don't want to receive news about your "likes" then have to follow his instructions.

   Try http://www.google.com/ncr  This is only one of several ways to do this according to Google :    Click the Google.com link on any other domain.  Choose a Google domain manually by visiting the Language Tools page (the section with the flags).  Bookmark http://www.google.com/ncr . This is an alternative web address for Google.com that always takes you to Google.com without redirecting you.

   Change your bookmarks, homepage etc to http://www.google.com/ncr This will ensure that it ignores the IP country detection.  Ensure you delete all cookies etc first.

   If you just want to permanently use google.com (or any other fixed URL) as the search engine, above two methods probably is not what you are looking for. /ncr and adding another search engine both breaks the default realtime search functionality. Try this,   Close all the Chrome/chromium browsers,  go to User Data folder   Windows: users\username\appdata\local\chromium\User Data (or similar - please edit if this is wrong)  Linux: ~/.config/chromium/Default   open the file named LocalState (windows) or Preferences in vim/notepad, and change,   last_known_google_url and  last_prompted_google_url to whatever the baseURL you want.

   A few ideas on the type of things:   Content explicitly disallowed by a domain's robots.txt file is excluded from the Google index.  Websites that are not linked from other websites that Google already knows. That is, there are probably a lot of websites that do not get linked from visible pages, those websites are never going to be found by the Google spider unless they're manually submitted to Google via the Webmaster Tools .  Websites that are behind web forms that you need to fill out.  Census images. Since the content are images that are often manually index, they usually found on paid-for sites like ancestry.com.

<answer>
   Clear the browser's cookies (and perhaps cache/history).   'Trust this computer' option doesn’t work  For computers you trust, Google recommends you select the "Trust this computer" option when you are asked for a verification code. When you check this box, you won’t have to enter a code every time you sign in to your account from that computer.  This feature uses a cookie to remember your browser when you sign in. If you’re still being asked to enter a code despite selecting the “Trust this computer” option, this might be because your browser is set to delete cookies after a certain period of time, or is set to delete cookies every time you quit the browser. You may also be manually clearing cookies from your browser. (emphasis added)

   According to Google Support :   Removing trusted computers from your list  You can remove computers from your set of trusted computers at any   time. To do so, sign in to your account and go to your 2-step   verification settings page. Under the “Advanced” section, you’ll have   the choice to remove the computer you’re using at the time or all   other computers. If you choose to remove other computers from your   trusted list, those computers will automatically sign out of your   account, and you’ll be prompted for a verification code next time you   try to sign in from them.

   You can use FengOffice , however, I don't think it has the ability to upload/download as office formats.  There is EtherPad , which google docs docs is based off of, but it only has word documents, and I don't think it has upload/download either.

<answer>
   Actually I myself have written something in the vein of google docs. It's backed by a mongoDb database. And I am willing to publish the source code of the project or send it to interested people. So hosting this on your own server would be no problem at all.  You can find the application here: http://mgdx.net/  This was written completely in PHP.  Currently only Rich-Text documents are supported. As in no spreadsheet or other documents. Features:   User management  Pages protected by username  Simple Rich-Text editing  Keyboard Shortcuts for editing &amp; saving  Nested documents  Optional listing of recent documents  PDF Export / Download  Responsive Design (works on mobile Devices)   For SpreadSheets I just found this: http://www.gelsheet.org/  It is stand-alone version of the FengOffice SpreadSheet module.

   MindTouch Platform and MindTouch Core are both self-hosted. The UI is non-invasive and very clean. You can use MindTouch Platform in conjunction with the desktop connecter to import your docs. More steps than viewing a document in Google Docs, but does give you the security of your fire wall. And the WYSIWYG editor makes editing documents as simple as Word.  [As a css junkie and a page linking maverick, I would much rather stay out of Office products and use a solution like MindTouch.] You can still "Paste from Word" in the free edition if you don't want to pay for Platform. You can start with a free trial of MindTouch Platform and downgrade to Core if you don't need the extra bells. Though I must say, I do love the extra bells myself!

   Use "Network inspector" function of your browser's script debugger and find second request to timedtext page after enabling transcribed subtitles then just copy all that request to the addressbar to download them in native YouTube xml format.  To get SRT version run this code in the debugger console for that xml's page:  function makeTimeline (time) {     var string, time_array = [], milliseconds = Math.round(time % 1 * 1000).toString();      while (3 &gt; milliseconds.length) {         milliseconds = '0' + milliseconds;     }      time_array.push(Math.floor(time / (60 * 60)));     time_array.push(Math.floor((time - (time_array[0] * 60 * 60)) / 60));     time_array.push(Math.floor(time - ((time_array[1] * 60) + (time_array[0] * 60 * 60))));      for (var i = 0, il = time_array.length; i &lt; il; i++) {         string = '' + time_array[i];         if (1 === string.length) {             time_array[i] = '0' + string;         }     }     return time_array.join(':') + ',' + milliseconds; };  function returnSRT (data) {     var caption, previous_start, start, end, temp, captions = data.getElementsByTagName('text'), srt_output = '';      for (var i = 0, il = captions.length; i &lt; il; i++) {         caption = captions[i];         start = +caption.getAttribute('start');          if (0 &lt;= previous_start) {             temp = captions[i - 1].textContent.replace(/&lt;/g, '&amp;lt;').replace(/&gt;/g, '&amp;gt;');             srt_output += i + '\n' + makeTimeline(previous_start) + ' --&gt; ' + makeTimeline(start) + '\n' + temp + '\n\n';             previous_start = -1;         }          if ( end = +caption.getAttribute('dur'))             end = start + end;         else {             if (captions[i + 1]) {                 previous_start = start;                 continue;             }         }          temp = caption.textContent.replace(/&lt;/g, '&amp;lt;').replace(/&gt;/g, '&amp;gt;');         srt_output += i + '\n' + makeTimeline(start) + ' --&gt; ' + makeTimeline(end) + '\n' + temp + '\n\n';     };     return srt_output; }  returnSRT(document.documentElement)  Also here is bookmarklet version of the script:  javascript:(function(){function%20makeTimeline(time)%7Bvar%20string%2Ctime_array%3D%5B%5D%2Cmilliseconds%3DMath.round(time%251*1000).toString()%3Bwhile(3%3Emilliseconds.length)%7Bmilliseconds%3D'0'%2Bmilliseconds%3B%7Dtime_array.push(Math.floor(time%2F(60*60)))%3Btime_array.push(Math.floor((time-(time_array%5B0%5D*60*60))%2F60))%3Btime_array.push(Math.floor(time-((time_array%5B1%5D*60)%2B(time_array%5B0%5D*60*60))))%3Bfor(var%20i%3D0%2Cil%3Dtime_array.length%3Bi%3Cil%3Bi%2B%2B)%7Bstring%3D''%2Btime_array%5Bi%5D%3Bif(1%3D%3D%3Dstring.length)%7Btime_array%5Bi%5D%3D'0'%2Bstring%3B%7D%7Dreturn%20time_array.join('%3A')%2B'%2C'%2Bmilliseconds%3B%7D%3Bfunction%20returnSRT(data)%7Bvar%20caption%2Cprevious_start%2Cstart%2Cend%2Ctemp%2Ccaptions%3Ddata.getElementsByTagName('text')%2Csrt_output%3D''%3Bfor(var%20i%3D0%2Cil%3Dcaptions.length%3Bi%3Cil%3Bi%2B%2B)%7Bcaption%3Dcaptions%5Bi%5D%3Bstart%3D%2Bcaption.getAttribute('start')%3Bif(0%3C%3Dprevious_start)%7Btemp%3Dcaptions%5Bi-1%5D.textContent.replace(%2F%3C%2Fg%2C'%26lt%3B').replace(%2F%3E%2Fg%2C'%26gt%3B')%3Bsrt_output%2B%3Di%2B'%5Cn'%2BmakeTimeline(previous_start)%2B'%20--%3E%20'%2BmakeTimeline(start)%2B'%5Cn'%2Btemp%2B'%5Cn%5Cn'%3Bprevious_start%3D-1%3B%7Dif(end%3D%2Bcaption.getAttribute('dur'))end%3Dstart%2Bend%3Belse%7Bif(captions%5Bi%2B1%5D)%7Bprevious_start%3Dstart%3Bcontinue%3B%7D%7Dtemp%3Dcaption.textContent.replace(%2F%3C%2Fg%2C'%26lt%3B').replace(%2F%3E%2Fg%2C'%26gt%3B')%3Bsrt_output%2B%3Di%2B'%5Cn'%2BmakeTimeline(start)%2B'%20--%3E%20'%2BmakeTimeline(end)%2B'%5Cn'%2Btemp%2B'%5Cn%5Cn'%3B%7D%3Breturn%20srt_output%3B%7Dwindow.location.href%3D'data%3Atext%2Fplain%3Bbase64%2C'%2Bbtoa(returnSRT(document.documentElement))})();

   There are a couple of ways to extract subtitles from a YouTube video -  By specifying the language and VideoId in this generic URL - http://www.youtube.com/api/timedtext?lang={LANG}&amp;v={VIDEOID} you can get an .xml file containing the subtitles in the desired language for a chosen video.  To get rid of the tags within that file and to just have the plain-text transcript , here is what you have to do:   Open up Microsoft Excel  Copy paste the subtitles inside one cell  Press Ctrl + H  In the replace tab type &lt;*&gt; in the "Find What" textbox and leave the "Replace With" textbox blank, and click Replace All . The search expression will remove all tags within the original text.   Alternatively, there is an open-source tool called Google2SRT that downloads all available subs from a YouTube video with one click &amp; converts them into .srt format so that it can be used within media players like VLC Media Player.  Update: Ted.com now provides transcripts of the talks on its site.

   If it is your own video, you can download the subtitles from the video manager. Go to:  Video Manager &gt;&gt; Edit (on the video you want) &gt;&gt; Captions &gt;&gt; (Click on the track you want to download) &gt;&gt; Actions (drop down box)  At the time of writing, there are three file types available:   .vtt  .srt  .sbv   These have different uses in different applications, but are very similar. SRT is probably the most common.  Otherwise, if it is not your video, the best method (only method) is to get the xml file from the Developer tools.  Using Google Chrome in this example, navigate to the video then follow these steps:   Pause the video. Wait for it to play if there is an advertisement.  Push F12 on your keyboard. This opens the developer tools. You may have to click on some empty space in the page so that the video is not active.  Click on the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Click the transcript icon just below the video. Two items will come up in the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Both items are titled timedtext? plus a bunch of variables. The second one is typically the one you want. It starts like this:  &lt;transcript&gt;      &lt;text start="4.14" dur="3.049"&gt;my name is doctor john rush&lt;/text&gt;      &lt;text start="7.189" dur="3.731"&gt;I'm the CEO and president&lt;/text&gt;   This xml file is useful if you want to use the transcript in a web page. Other than that, I don't think you can use it the same way you would use an SRT file. If you are any good at programming, you can easily write up a program that will convert it to SRT. I wrote my own C# program that extracts the data for a different purpose and it took less than two hours.

How do you share a Facebook photo album with people that don't want to register for Facebook?
</question>
<answer>
   The correct way currently is via Alex answer of going to the cogwheel and selecting share.   Previously   Go to the album link by going to My Uploads , and click on   the album you want to share. The link should be something similar to  http://www.facebook.com/album.php?id=[userid]&amp;aid=[albumid]  Then scroll to the bottom of the page , there you should   find the public link    Share this album with anyone by      sending them this public link:  http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.999737156697.2491284.13608786&amp;type=1&amp;l=a91b17b9fa  The above is mine , logout of Facebook and you will see you     can access it. Also your Album Privacy should be set to everyone     for this to work.        
</answer>
<answer>
    Go to your profile  Go to your photos  Go to Albums  Go to the respective album  Click on the cog wheel in the upper-right side of the album   From the drop-down menu, click on Get Link  Send the link from the modal window to anybody you want    You don't need to set the album's privacy to public. That link gives anybody who has it the possibility to see the album.   Previously:   Go to your profile  Go to your Photos  Go to the respective album  Scroll down to the bottom of the album  Copy the link appearing there:  Send that link to anybody you want

   The above mentioned solutions do not work anymore.  Instead, open the folder you want to download and click to select individual files, or press Ctrl + A to select all files. A row of buttons will appear above the list of files, click the Download button to download the selected files as a Zip compressed archive.  EDIT: Matthew Crumley's solution works as well, just be sure not to click the folder name itself, as it will open the folder instead of selecting it. The Download button will appear in the row of buttons above the folder list, and not in a drop-down menu as mentioned.

   Here is a way to download folders all at once. I work for a law firm and We had a HUGE document production to download.  25 folders on the main page with subfolders inside. I was VERY glad I discovered this method.  It took minutes to do as compared to saving each document individually. The above options did not work for me so if they didn't work for you either, try this.  Go to the opening screen for your project in Dropbox and click on the "DOWNLOAD" button, then RIGHT click on "Download as .zip" option and choose "Save Target as".  This will permit you to navigate to your hard drive to save the zip file where you desire.  To open the zip file, again right click and choose "Open With" then "WINZIP" (if that is your extraction program of choice) and another screen will open so you can then extract the files.

Can I set an e-mail to send on a timer within Gmail?
</question>
<answer>
   You can't do this natively with GMail but you can do it with browser extensions:   Streak is free and has a "Send later" feature.  RightInbox is free for up to 10 emails per month  Boomergang is free for up to 10 emails per month       
</answer>
<answer>
   Despite requests for this feature since 2009, the Gmail team refused to implement it.  There are however browser extensions and apps that let you schedule new emails or replies:   Streak is a free browser extension CRM for Gmail and has a "Send later" feature (you don't need to bother with the CRM at all). You can conveniently schedule a reply right from the Compose box. I've been using it for about a year and it works very well, except that if I change the Subject line, the message won't go through. You need to go in Drafts and Send it Later from there again, under the new Subject line. Works for Google Apps accounts, as well as Gmail. Best choice.  RightInbox is free for up to 10 emails per month, and supports email tracking via an embedded image (web bug). I've used it in its early stage while it was very buggy and corresponded with its author. You can schedule replies right from the Compose window.  Boomergang is free for up to 10 emails per month. After that, it's $5/mo for Gmail accounts and $15 for Google Apps accounts.  Gmail Delay Send is a script you have to install via Google Docs. I tried it; the process was somewhat convoluted and the tool is rough and immature. It is however fully free and open source, and won't add any additional load to your browser (unlike extensions). This is the most promising and most lightweight solution . Unfortunately, it has seen no development since May 2012 .  Momento Mail is a Google App (not a browser extension), and you have to use their own website. As of November 2013, it no longer works (directs to a blank page after typing in the scheduling and recipient info). To schedule a reply, you'd have to copy/paste the To, CC and email body from Gmail. Quite cumbersome. Their "To" field doesn't support the standard address format Name &lt;address@company.com&gt; . The message won't end up in your Gmail Sent folder, but you have an option to BCC yourself. Least recommended.       
</answer>
<answer>
   You could use Boomerang .   Free  Works with Gmail  Easy to use  Mentioned in lots of reputable sources like Inc magazine But  It asks for information on your gmail account. I'm not sure how safe that is.       
</answer>
<answer>
   Not via the web UI, no. You would need to use POP or IMAP and send the email from a client (such as Outlook, Thunderbird, and others) that supports delayed sending.      
</answer>
<answer>
   There is now a bit of script that you can install through Google docs that will let you save a draft with the delivery time and apply a label to have the email automatically sent.  I have not tried this myself, but it came up while I was looking for a solution to this problem.  http://code.google.com/p/gmail-delay-send/      
</answer>
<answer>
   You would need to use a third-party app for that.  TimeCave looks like it might do that for you. From their "about" page:   The idea is simple: drop an email   message into Time Cave and tell it   when to come out. It'll stay there for   as long as you'd like, within reason.   (We wouldn't want stalactites to   dissolve it.) So for days, weeks,   months, or even years, Time Cave will   hold onto your message. Once the   message's time comes, it's speedily   sent on its way back toward you ( or   whomever you addressed it to ).   (emphasis mine)      
</answer>
<answer>
   You can do it completely inside Google - without any third-party applications.  Digital Inspiration provides a script that you can run in a Google Spreadsheet. It draws the message IDs from your drafts and let's you select a date for the message to be sent. Another column tells you the status of each message (Not Scheduled, Scheduled, Delivered, etc).  You can make a copy of the original spreadsheet into your own Google Drive by finding the link on the blog - http://www.labnol.org/internet/schedule-gmail-send-later/24867/ .

How to hide contacts from Hangouts within Gmail
</question>
<answer>
   Click on the Contact to open the previous Hangout you had with them. Click on the Gear and "archive" the hangout.      
</answer>
<answer>
   In new Hangouts , the list is no longer a list of contacts, but a list of saved hangouts. Google took a guess to populate the list from the start. As you have real hangouts, they will replace entries on the list.  The only other way is to block the contact, which may bring up another new guesses from Google. This will eventually be replaced as you have real hangouts.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Mouse over the contact you no longer want to see in your GChat list, click the down arrow in the lower right-hand side, and click "never show."      
</answer>
<answer>
    Click on the person you want to delete in the chat list box (a contact box will pop up);  On the right-hand side, above the contact card, are the options: left arrow / add to my contacts / groups / e-mail / more;  Click the More tab—a window will open with “Delete” at the top;  It will delete all that persons info from your list.       
</answer>
<answer>
   I have a similar problem on my chrome hangouts extension.  I have contacts on there that I don't want to block, but I don't want to look at them all day either.  Only way I can hide them by blocking.      
</answer>
<answer>
   You cannot permanently hide them. Some solutions that might help you achieve what you really want, however:   At the bottom left of the web page is a little image that seems to be a quotation mark inside of a chat bubble. Upon click, Hangouts is hidden (but not disabled, and you are not logged out or hidden).  Click on an entry in the Hangouts box to open the old Hangout. Click the settings button (image of a gear). Click the archive button. This does not necessarily remove the conversation from the list, but many times will. (You cannot empty the list by doing this.)

   You can try a service as SpyPig to sent you a notification when your email has been read.   SpyPig is a simple email tracking   system that sends you a notification   email as soon as the recipient opens   and reads your message.  It works with virtually all modern   email programs: Outlook, Eudora, Yahoo   Email, Gmail, Hotmail, AOL Email and   many others.  Basic Requirement   Both you and the recipient must use an   HTML email, not plain-text or   rich-text email. Visit the Requirements &amp; Limitations page to   learn more about SpyPig.   Kudos to labnol.org for the suggestion!

   Similar to the suggestion by @Ivo, whoreadme is, you guessed it, a tool that can track who has read and forwarded your emails.   WhoReadMe is embedded a transparent   tracking image into your HTML e-mail.   The image is assigned with unique ID   and stored in WhoReadMe server. Once   your recipient opens your e-mail,   tracking image will be loaded from   WhoReadMe server . Therefore, WhoReadMe   is alerted to send you notification.   However, it still has the problems associated with this method of tracking if an email has read in that generally, people will not have their email client set to download images by default .

How to replace a video on YouTube
</question>
<answer>
   What you are wanting to do is not possible.  Quote from YouTube Help ( Replace old video with a new one ):   There is currently no way to replace an old video with a new one and retain the original view count, comments or ratings. You'll have to start over with your newer video.       
</answer>
<answer>
   It should't be possible and I hope it's not. The reason is simple: Let's say you are uploading one really interesting video that goes viral with few millions views and then you are changing it to something completely boring. Wouldn't it be a little bit confusing for the new viewers on why exactly this video got so many views?  I think you can make few tweaks to the video from what YouTube offers you and maybe the editor could help, but I'm not a YouTuber to know anything more.      
</answer>
<answer>
   In my opinion, probably the issue is not that YouTube would or would not allow video replacement but it’s the original content that can't be altered. By allowing such ability, it would contaminate the authenticity of original content.

<question>
How does the Facebook friend finder operate?
</question>
<answer>
   Facebook has access to all friendship-data on their site, even if you lock down the privacy settings. As an addition many users share their contact-book or even e-mails with Facebook. Most peoples have filled out their profile quite decent so it has data about your school, your employer, your current place, your interests and so on. Although Facebook states it does not use it, they can track all users (and even non-users) across many websites via the "like"-button which is transcluded directly from Facebook.  From this data it can calculate this friend requests.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I just created a new Facebook profile. I used a dummy email address to create the page.  Facebook then starts suggesting - GUESS WHO - myself, my gf, my sister and my closest friends as "people I might know".  Consequently, Facebook must go much deeper than just look at your friends and whose profile you are looking at - they seem to have monitored my IP address and connected the new Facebook profile to my old profile. Then they suggested myself and my friends.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Even though your security settings are "locked down", Facebook still can use your friends list to find other people you may know. Other people may not be able to find you but Facebook can and will still use your information (such as your friend list). They cross reference your list of friends to your friends' friend list to find people you may know. There is probably some kind of complex algorithm behind who exactly they suggest. The algorithm probably checks for multiple friends in common, current location (for distance), similar groups, similar schools, employers, etc.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I suspect that "stalking" and similar activities might also have an impact.  In other words, if a person A repeatedly visits the public profile of another person B, then Facebook might deduce and suggest to B (and maybe even to established friends of B) that A is a friend.

<answer>
   A few years back, Lifehacker recommended webapp TimeBridge for scheduling meetings. I haven't used it personally but it looks like it meets all of your criteria except :   The ability to copy and paste a list of names and email addresses to specify recipients for your meeting request: Not sure if it does that; however, they do provide "connectors" for Outlook and Google Calendar that hook into your address book.  Something that gives recipients a unique one-click URL to specify their free time: also unsure of this; the only way of finding out would be to create an account and try it. (I didn't do that, though.)       
</answer>
<answer>
   MeetingWizard meets criteria 1,2,4 and 5.  I think it meets criteria 3 "copy and paste list of email addresses".  An address book is maintained within the application.  Rather than tediously entering each address in the address book, go directly to "Create a meeting request".  Propose one or more dates and times.  On the next "Meeting Event Details" screen, paste your list of email addresses, one address per line or separate with a  comma, to a maximum of 50.  Select the "Add all new addresses to Address Book" box, to eliminate entering the addresses the next time.  I recently implemented this for a local community band.  Many of the musicians are not comfortable using computers, so the two click response without the need for a login was excellent.  The response rate 75%+ greatly exceeded what we were getting with just email.   It has lots of features which came in handy eg reminders to non-responders, adding additional details, printing lists of people attending etc.  The price is great; free.  At one time they had planned a paid version for more than 50 email addresses, but that option does not appear on the website.

   My personal favorite lately has been When2meet .  Time selection is easily clickable/draggable, reporting is intuitive and visual, and there's minimal setup involved (read: practically none).  There is no contact list integration, but you can send the short, private link directly to your recipients.  And, of course, it's free!  The only criterion listed above which I'd say it falls a bit short on is the ability for the organizer to specify time intervals that are "on the table".  You can specify a list of dates, and a range of times on those dates, but that range must be contiguous and the same across dates.  In effect, the organizer doesn't get special priority in limiting the choices.  Although it wasn't one of your criteria, it also lacks time zone support, so it's really only good for face-to-face or highly localized meetings.

Plus you have the added advantage of being able to access your bookmarks even if you are not on your personal machine(s). Delicious does allow you to keep your bookmarks private if you wish.

<answer>
   Grooveshark ( www.grooveshark.com )  Online Music streaming, music recommendation and sharing   Restrictions    It is flash based (if that is a restriction)  Mobile apps are available only for paying customers.    Pros  Great UI  Large collection of songs, ability to create, save and share playlists  A good song recommendation engine  Radio  Internationally available  Free    Cons  Non-paying customers can't use mobile apps      
</answer>
<answer>
   Pandora ( www.pandora.com )  Pandora uses the Music Genome Project to find and play music you might like based on artists and pieces you tell it you already enjoy. You can then vote up or vote down individual songs, and it will learn what types of music you like and give you additional music that suits your tastes.   Restrictions    You cannot choose to play an individual specific song  Only available in the USA  You cannot skip ahead or back within a song, but can skip a song entirely  Limited to 6 skips per hour per station, 12 skips total per day   Limited to 40 hours per month, costs $0.99 to continue using for the rest of the month if you go over the limit    Pros   Exposes you to tons of new music which you'll probably enjoy and might not have known about  Has free Windows 7/Vista desktop gadget, iPhone/iPod app, and an easy-to-use web interface  Is pretty smart about learning what you like  Multiple "stations", so that your interests in music can be kept separate. Things you "like" in one station won't affect what you get in another station, providing some separation if you have diverse music tastes but don't want genres to overlap.    Cons   Restrictions (see above)  Doesn't have as much music by independent artists, but there is some    Extra Details  I highly recommend Pandora. I use it very frequently, and it's a nice way to listen to music you already like and hear new music.  The lovely desktop gadget:

   A good alternative I can recommend is "The Sixty One".  While it's probably not directly as you described, it's a brilliant way of finding new and (most likely) unknown music, the flow is great, and it has quite a bit different styles. On top of that, it has a funky optional quest-system, that gives it a rather unique touch.  To summarize, I'd add it as this, hope that helps:  The Sixty One ( http://www.thesixtyone.com )  Pros:   Nice way to find new music  Great radio-system  Lets you save music, and have different playlists  Option to donate money to some of the artists, and upvote songs.  Some tracks are available as free/paid downloads  Fun and different quest- and achievement-system   Cons:   A bit tricky UI, that takes a while to get used to (an older version is still running here: http://old.thesixtyone.com/ It might be easier to get around)  Has some various bugs from time to time

   Jango  Subscribe to specific artists, like/dislike songs and get recommendations for more songs, Just Works TM.  Pros - Free  - No funny features like 'props' or DJ capabilities , just plain old internet radio that works.  - Easy setup - select a bunch of artists you like, and train the recommendation engine by liking/dislking songs.  Cons   Not all music is available at all time. You can search for specific songs, but at times some songs might not be available for playing (due to licensing issues I think).

</question>
<answer>
   No, not possible.  Can't see it on the web interface or on any of the apps on linked devices.  Your only near option currently is to see what has been done after the fact by checking out the recent events page on Dropbox .      
</answer>
<answer>
   For anyone looking at this question in 2014+, you can now see what is being synced (on a Mac at least—I don't know the answer for Windows, but I'm sure someone will provide that answer).  Hold Alt , and click on the Dropbox icon in menubar. This will show you what is currently being synced.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I'm trying to figure out the same thing. best I've got so far is to look at the sync icons on the folders .  You can at least narrow it down to "which folder contains the files which are currently syncing" ...  In my case it's the "Camera Uploads" folder, so I'm going to look on the dropbox website to see what the largest files in that folder are... then check whether they're on my local machine. probably some videos or something.      
</answer>
<answer>
   If you're under Linux, type this in the command-line:  find ~/Dropbox -type f -exec dropbox filestatus {} \; | grep 'syncing'      
</answer>
<answer>
   In Windows, the way to see what's still to sync is to look in your file system Explorer.  There, there will be your Dropbox folder and those files or folders containing files will have a blue sync icon versus those already uploaded successfully with a green check mark.  Now, it's also possible to see the latest upload events by clicking on the Dropbox icon in the system tray, or to track events online, but afaik, there's no way to see what file will be syncing next.

How can I export my Google chat logs?
</question>
<answer>
   The IMAP interface to Gmail now provides access to chat messages . If you had already set up Gmail IMAP, then you only have to enable the IMAP visibility for the "Chat" label in the Gmail settings (in the "Label" tab, a "show in IMAP" tick box is available for each label).  Update : this method works for Google Chat, but NOT for Hangouts, only conversations of the type Google Chat are exposed via IMAP, roughly all conversations until Spring/Summer 2013, depending on when one has enabled Google Hangouts.  Sources:   GMvault/chats no longer being saved  Gmail Migration/Can we download Google Hangouts history   The latter link provides an alternative to download via Google Takeout in the JSON format

   Forward them to an email address you have POP/IMAP access to.      
</answer>
<answer>
   There is no explicit way of exporting your Google Chat logs through a Google provided function but there are a number of different alternative methods which seem to be available.   The first, as mentioned by Simon, is to forward them to an email address where you can download them via POP/IMAP.  You can install the "Create a Document" labs experiment for Google Mail which allows you to create a document for each chat. This could be quite laborious though and then you have to backup from Google Docs, which is another step.  There appears to be a python script here which backups Google Chat logs. However, in the comments there appears to be some issues with being temporarily locked out if you download too much at once.       
</answer>
<answer>
   Have a look "How to do that", without use of any software http://digivorous.blogspot.com/2010/11/how-to-download-and-backup-your.html      
</answer>
<answer>
   You could make a filter in GMail to do the heavy lifting for you.  When making a new filter, put "in:chats" in the "Has the words:" blank, and then choose the action you want to take (such as forwarding).  By the way, it's useful to note that the "Has the words:" blank functions just like the search bar above (as far as I can tell), so you can enter all kinds of search operators in there to make really complex filters!      
</answer>
<answer>
   none of the forwarding labelling filtering solutions work...  "no old mail will be forwarded"   it appears that option 3 is the only solution that may work - but even that has the risk of being locked out for 24 hours - or whatever.   AMAZING! - Why is it that we cannot access the chat logs? is there some legal issue? I have searched for this on many occasion and always give up.  There isn't a clear answer that I can find anywhere and all the supposed answers come up short... and last time I tried, I could not get the Python script to work - but then I was on x64, and not very familiar with Python in the first place.  I am about to try again - crossing my fingers.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I have figured out a way to get them out via forwarding them, using a browser scripting tool call iMacros.  I think this macro will only work with Firefox 3.6 which you can get from this link .  I wont go into installing and setting either of them up, but here is the macro I used.  VERSION BUILD=7300701 RECORDER=FX TAB T=1 FRAME F=4 TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:hE&amp;&amp;TXT:Reply WAIT SECONDS=.5 TAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=NAME:NoFormName ATTR=NAME:to CONTENT=test@GMAIL.COM TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TABINDEX:1&amp;&amp;ROLE:button&amp;&amp;TXT:Send WAIT SECONDS=3 TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ALT:&amp;&amp;SRC:images/cleardot.gif&amp;&amp;CLASS:iHkD0e&amp;&amp;TXT: WAIT SECONDS=2  Just replace 'test@gmail.com' with the email address you want to forward to.  Now the only other key piece of advice is where to start the loop of the macro.  To do it right, you will want to create a label and assign all your gmail chats to it.  This will allow you to see your chats in chronological order and forward them that way.  Then in gmail click on the label, when the list opens it will likely open to the newest first.  Therefore, go the the last page of the labels contents.  Open the last item.  here is when you click "play loop" in iMacros.  I had 1k chats to export.  You'll notice there are "wait" statements in the code, this will give the browser time to keep up. They may need tweaking.  Also, check back every couple of minutes, because it sometimes throws an error, or tries to move to the next (newer) chat before the email has been sent.  Just click "cancel" and it will go back to the script and the email will have been sent.  If it throws any other errors during operation, you should be able to adjust the loop duration and start it again with no problems.  This has been aggravating me for so long since I switched Gmail accounts due to spam, so I am finally happy to close that account having got all my content out.

   Write it out:  -f : perldoc -f -X . If no file name is specified (as is the case here) checks if $_ contains the name of a plain file  &gt; : Checks if the RHS is greater than the LHS  @+ : In scalar context, returns the number of elements in @+  ? : the conditional operator  *&lt; : The glob for main::&lt;  . : String concatenation operator  -&amp;'_ : Invokes a subroutine main::_ . FYI, ' is the perl4 style package name separator. Try perl -MHTML'Template -e 1 .  : : Continuing with conditional operator  $# : The output format for printed numbers  / : Division operator  %! : %ERRNO ; see perldoc perlvar   So, it is not impossible to understand if you put a little effort into it. Clearly, this is not how anyone should write programs, but there some benefit from people pushing the boundaries.

   I noticed that some words with punctuation are indexed.  For example:   C++  i++  Micro$oft   Here's Google's official documentation of this feature :   Punctuation that is not ignored   Punctuation in popular terms that have particular meanings, like [ C++ ] or [ C# ] (both are names of programming languages), are not ignored.  The dollar sign ($) is used to indicate prices. [ nikon 400 ] and [ nikon $400 ] will give different results.  The hyphen - is sometimes used as a signal that the two words around it are very strongly connected. (Unless there is no space after the - and a space before it, in which case it is a negative sign.)  The underscore symbol _ is not ignored when it connects two words, e.g. [ quick_sort ].

   Google doesn't search for punctuation characters as far as I know.

   To download your data, log into Facebook, then click the little arrow in the top right and select "Account Settings".  In the bottom left of your "General Account Settings" find the line of text that says "Download a copy of your Facebook data" and click the link.       
</answer>
<answer>
   You can try going to http://m.facebook.com/ and click on "Messages".  Select a person to view the history, and click on "See Older Messages" once.  Notice that &amp;start= part in the URL, that's the number of received and sent messages minus 7.  Notice the &amp;page_size=7 part in the URL. Currently, Facebook does not limit this number, you can set that to a number bigger than the start value. This makes it disable pagination and displays all the messages it found, except the skipped 7. (If the number's smaller, somehow Facebook will display only 7).  ** To make it work on Chrome, left click on "See Older Messages" and choose "open in a new tab" and there you will find the "page_size=" number to change. (May 2013)      
</answer>
<answer>
   To start, use a computer and open the Google Chrome browser. If you don’t have Google Chrome, then download it. Then use the Google Chrome browser to go to http://m.facebook.com/messages/  Then click the person you want to see the first message with.  Now press Ctrl + Shift + J and then paste this code into the lower window that pops up, and then press Enter . It will then proceed to load old messages until it reaches the very first message. Here is the code:  setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  The above code can also be found on this website: http://jsfiddle.net/magicramki/k9gda3cu/  If you do not want to go back all the way, you will need to stop the script. In order to do that, you will first need to define it as a variable:  var myVar=setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  Then to stop it, you will simply need to enter the following command:  window.clearInterval(myVar)  You can resume the script anytime by typing the first part again.  Now once it loads everything, you have two options. You can right click anywhere on the page and choose "save as" and then save that file somewhere on your computer. Then use Google Chrome to open it when you want to view it later (won't look right in Internet Explorer). This will save the entire chat, complete with pictures and emoticons. When you want to search for a particular day, press Ctrl + F to bring up the find box. Then type in "Mar 2", for example, to bring up the conversation on March 2nd.  The second option is to highlight the parts that you want to save, and then copy by pressing Ctrl + C . Then open Microsoft Word and paste that into the document by pressing Ctrl + V . Now save that file. This will save the text and pictures, but not the emoticons.

   Download a copy of your Facebook data: click the little arrow in the top right and select "Account Settings". Then find the line of text that says "Download a copy of your Facebook data" and click the link.  I wrote a handy python script called mesExtractor that help you extract any conversation in your Facebook data. Using this script, I'm able to extract 60k+ messages in one conversation of my Facebook data. See the demo from github here:

   If you use Chrome, I have an extension just for this purpose.  Here is the link Messages Saver for Facebook .  I didn't try the really big chats, but what I have (up to 15,000 messages) it saves. You can also save in parts.  You can choose whether to save your chat as just text, an html file with all smileys, emojis, pictures and other files embedded, or as a zip file, then all the files will be saved locally to your computer.

Turn sound off for notification sounds   Click menu ▼ at the top of your Hangouts list.  Check the box next to "Mute."    From: Google Hangouts - Turn off notification sounds

See this answer   As of today (2013/05/21), you can't (even though it's requested ), but I found a way to prevent the sound to be loaded and therefore played.  In short: I redirect the link to the alert audio file (which you can find at the bottom of the answer) to a non-existent one.  This is how:   Download the extension Redirector from the Chrome Web Store  visit: chrome-extension://lacckjdlmkdhcacjdodpjokfobckjclh/html/options.html#ruleMgr  click on [+]  set it like in this screenshot  save  you might have to restart Chrome (or the Hangouts extensions)    Text to enter:  ssl.gstatic.com/* incoming_message_eb39ce414e3ffba41a8e173581dc7248  To see if it works, try this url, it shouldn't load  https://ssl.gstatic.com/chat/sounds/incoming_message_eb39ce414e3ffba41a8e173581dc7248.mp3

   There is a pretty in-depth post about how Facebook Search works posted on Facebook Engineering's page:  http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=365915113919      
</answer>
<answer>
   Here's what I've noticed.  Whenever I search for a friend on facebook, I start to type the person's name, and after the first few letters, I get a list of people who's first or last name starts with the letters I've typed.  NORMALLY, the list of friends starts with people I'm already friends with, and leads into people who I might possibly know through mutual friends.  BUT...  I've recently started dating a guy.  Now, when I type in the letter "G" to search my friend Georgia, the first person on my list is my boyfriend's best friend who's last name begins with "G".  Then I tried "K" for Kelly.  Instead of seeing my friend Kelly who would normally appear, I get a list of people with the last name Keats - my boyfriend's sisters, mother, aunt, and cousins.  I haven't visited any of these profiles before, so I'm guessing that they're all checking out mine to see what the new girl is all about.  That just goes to show that the search results are based, at least in part, on profile visits.

   It's possible that he is more active with you on facebook than with the other friends, which would place the first Rachel higher in the algorithm than the Rachel who is friends with people he doesn't interact with as much.  Again, this is just conjecture as I don't work for Facebook.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I feel it has to do with who views your page, for how long, who you view, for how long,  and how frequently you search them. Your friends probably has a somewhat large value to show up first and/or their friends and the value can probably be lowered than a non-friend due to the time factor spent on a non-friend's page. Maybe even clicks is played into the search. There is a complicated formula. Facebook is crazy about this stuff. In the movie, when Mark (facebook CEO) did the site about which girl at school was hot or not, he ask a friend to come up with a formula to determine a winner. With how brilliant facebook has become, I don't doubt for a second that they take into consideration all these factors and 20,000 others when designing this formula.  I liked this guy and I couldn't find his page. Of course he was searching me as well and I'm assuming the reason why I was unable to search him was because he made his page only searchable to friends. (he has a girlfriend that's why and didn't want me to know) When he did allow me to search him, he was the first one after I typed his name. I didn't see this before.      
</answer>
<answer>
   It starts with the letter of input makes a quick query from multiple database's and or tables.  Say you start typing v.  It looks first for any of your friends names that start with a v.  If it finds a friend it then displays it.  I've noticed that if you have a friends page that you visit more often.  If you then start typing the first letter it shows that as a first result.  So it seems they save your frequently searched allowing them to give you better results.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I can definitely say that there are people who have come up on that list who are not my Facebook friends, and who I have never looked up, and I recognize them from my past. Also, I have an old flame who I looked up and he was at the top of my list there, then he moved to the third one down (all three starting with the letter A), and I didn't look him up again, and then he moved to the top.  Hard to say but I would guess the one's at the top are looking at your profile.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Mutual friends show up first. As you type close to some name and the results are not your friends and you had never visited their profiles, then it is someone who visited you recently.  Also the pages and people you visit the most pop up first.      
</answer>
<answer>
   I am actually almost certain it has to do with people who view your page because I was thinking about this and conducted a little experiment (it's kinda confusing but bear with me).  I started off by typing every letter of the alphabet and seeing who came up on the search. So for example, I typed "A" and saw who came up. I noticed that the list of people were not necessarily in alphabetical order, but the people at the top were certainly my closest friends whose pages I visit all the time.  Then I thought maybe Facebook sets the search bar up conveniently for you to find the people you visit the most. But then I saw something strange, the girl that I just added was actually the second person in the "L" list, the first being my best friend, so that seemed odd to me.  So then I started thinking that it might actually have to do with the people who visit your page. To test the theory, I went to my "C" list, where the top two people were actually pretty much equal in terms of how many times I've visited their page and I assume they've visited mine. I went to the second person in the "C" list and clicked on their page a lot, refreshed it a few good times. Then I went back and searched "C" and sure enough, it was now the second friend whose page I had been refreshing who showed up first . I knew that this second friend was camping and had no Facebook/no way of looking at my page.  Now here's the real kicker: I told my other friend in the "C" list, the one who used to be first when I searched "C" to go on my page a couple of times. She did. I then took a couple of minutes and searched "C" again, and guess who came up first?  That's right, the girl who had just searched my page, despite the fact that I had been looking up the other girl's page recently.  Does this really prove that the Facebook search bar operates on people who have viewed your profile? Maybe, but it could also prove that I have WAY too much time on my hands.      
</answer>
<answer>
   When I go on to my boyfriend's profile and type the letter C in his search bar then the first result is his ex girlfriend, whom he is not friends with on facebook, so I think it can show up the people who look at your page as he swears he's only been on her page once in the last year and a half and yet she shows up ahead of his friends pages. If this is not the case, he'll be single soon!

   I've been watching my friends search for a while..a little OCD... LOL  and when I search someone who is a friend on facebook and one who is not a friend the most recent searched person moves to the top. I stopped looking at the one who is not a facebook friend expecting him to move down the list and he did for a while staying steady in the same spot for months then he went to the top of my list for weeks...This happened many times so I finally asked him about it and he denies looking at my profile but I don't believe him.  it seems as though facebook keeps track of who you search first then who searches you(unless they look a lot then they go to the 1st position) then anyone you private message then ones you have the most interaction with.

   I finally figured out the Facebook search bar trick!! So for years there's been this rumor that the search bar is the key to finding out who views your FB. They say it's just a legend... Not really!! So legend has it that if you type in a letter, the first result is either the person you searched for/looked at last... Or if you never have, that person has looked at you! Or they search for you frequently, or both.  ( It also works based on interaction, for friends especially, but I have found this to work for friends who never interact with you, as well as friends of friends who have never had interaction.)  So I conducted a little experiment and found out that the trick does work - but ONLY IF YOU'RE BOTH SEARCHING  for each other! That's the missing link. I had someone view me... Nothing. They were still in position 4 down from the top. I search for someone else, who has not viewed me, and nothing - they're still a low result. But then I search for the person who viewed me on the same day, and boom! Less than 3 hours later, they were result number one when I typed in their first or last name initials!! Incidently, this works for friends, or friends of friends, even those who only have one mutual friend in common with you!  (Important: don't try to cheat by partially typing their name. First initial only, for first or last names! Also, this works for the full-site FB, which I use on my phone as a modification to the mobile FB. It does not work with the iPhone app.)  If you search for someone, friend or not, they will still show in your top 5 results for up to a day or so, then they rank lower and not even show in your top 3 if you don't search again. If you search for someone and they instantly (about 3 hours later) rank 1st after that, they've been searching for/looking at you too! If they eventually drop in ranking, either another one of your friends with the same initials interacted with you recently, or you're the only interested party...  Of course, this will be difficult to track if you're stalking them and click on them several times a day, LOL! But I've found that one single search is enough to set it off. ( I keep track of my searches by using the search log. Clearing your searches can throw off results after a couple of hours, too.) I've tried this experiment on multiple days... Same results. (In case you're wondering where I find the time, the answer is that I don't sleep a lot!)

</question>
<answer>
   I agree with the previous answer in that you can not disable the auto-save but there are a couple easy workarounds that will allow you to work on your document while at the office.  After you login to Google Docs and are looking at your list of documents, hover your mouse over the document in question. You should see an 'Actions' dropdown appear to the right. If you click on that you should be given the option to 'download' the file.  Now you can work on your document locally on your office computer and when you are done for the day just upload it back to Google Docs.   :)      
</answer>
<answer>
   Short answer is you can't.  Reference: http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google%20Docs/thread?tid=65db7066c04cde70&amp;hl=en      
</answer>
<answer>
   Yeah, you can't disable it for now but if you really want on-demand saving then you might want to try a compromise. If you have Microsoft Office, you could install Google's Cloud Connect . It is a free plugin that integrates Microsoft Office and Google Docs. With it, you can edit your document offline and then sync your edits with Google Docs.  If you're using OpenOffice then you could use OpenOffice.org2GoogleDocs . It does pretty much the same thing with the added benefit that you could connect it to Zoho Docs and your own WEBDAV servers as well.      
</answer>
<answer>
   You can't disable auto saving, but you can have it happen offline.  Make sure that you have offline Google Docs enabled and that your document is downloaded.  Then, disconnect the internet.  Start editing that document.  Now, you will be editing the offline version.  At this point, you can safely reconnect to the internet.  This will NOT force you to edit the online version of the document; you will still be editing the offline version until you click on the "reconnect to online docs" link (or whatever it's called).  Thus, you can edit offline even when online.  At the end of the day, when you are finished editing, you can reconnect and sync the chances with the online version.  This achieves offline editing without any of the mess of downloading, uploading, and having to deal with conversion and bad formatting.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Possible solution...?  I found autosave to be the most frustrating "feature" I've ever experienced - especially when editing text in a cell... at one point I timed the autosave refresh and it was kicking in every 11 seconds.  This meant that I could edit text for no longer than 11 seconds before it kicked in and wiped out whatever I had typed.  I about gave up and then decided to clear cache and restart the Chrome... presto!  After re-entering the Google Sheet and editing text in a cell the autosave feature patiently waited until I was done to save / refresh.  Not sure why this worked but give it a try and maybe it will improve the user experience for you as well.  Good luck!

How can I recursively set ownership of Google Drive files and folders?
</question>
<answer>
   I created a command-line tool to handle this.  After following the setup instructions on the GitHub project, you can run the tool with a specified path prefix and the email address of the new owner:  python transfer.py PATH-PREFIX NEW-OWNER-EMAIL  After getting authorization from OAuth, it will recursively walk the Google Drive account it got authorization to, match against the path prefix (ignoring non-matches), and then transfer ownership to the new email. If the new email address indicates a user who isn't even shared on the item yet, it will handle that as well. The current owner will not lose access, but the new or old owner can revoke it.  I should note that it's not always possible to transfer ownership of an item in Drive. For example, it's not possible to move ownership for an item from G Suite (Google Apps for Work) account to a normal GMail account. It can be shared (which the script will do), but ownership transfer will fail.

   The best way I have found to do this is to head on over to the "All Items" view, keep on scrolling down until no more files load, and then hit the tick box on top which selects all files and folders in the current view. Once all items are selected, click more, and then share and share again. In the share box change to the appropriate sharing levels and click done.  The only caveat here is you change the permissions for ALL of your files and folders.

   It's very simple, at least in the current version of Gmail.   Hover the mouse cursor over the recipient's name in the default message view until a pop-up card appears  Click Add to contacts on the pop-up card       
</answer>
<answer>
   This is a little bit of a pain, and I'm not 100% sure about it, but it seems to work in my tests.  If you click the name of the person you want to add as a contact while viewing the message, there is an option to click their e-mail address to send them a message. Click that, then discard the message. Click their name again in the original; there is an option under "More" for "contact details". Click that and you can add the other stuff you want and add them to a real group.  It appears that sending--or at least, starting to send--a message to an e-mail address puts it into your contacts under "All Contacts".   Google has added several improvements to Gmail since I originally posted this. drnbv's answer is much more useful.

I found a quick solution, here is what I did:  Beside the list of recipients I pressed the 'show details' down arrow.  Then I copied the list of recipient emails.  I went to the contacts view for Gmail. Clicked Add to Contacts and pasted the emails in.  At the left hand side I expanded the list of contact groups and clicked "New Group...".  I followed the steps to make a new group.  Then I clicked the "Add to contact list" button and pasted in the list of contacts again.  Done!

How can I purposely send a message that will be marked as spam in Gmail?
</question>
<answer>
   Use the Generic Test for Unsolicited Bulk Email ( GTUBE ). It's a standardized spam signature used precisely for testing spam filters.  Put this in the body of the test email:  XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X  and it will force it to be recognized by Gmail as spam.      
</answer>
<answer>
   What I ended up doing, which worked really well, was creating an email with some text in the body:   This is a test of the email system.   This is not a real spam message, but   rather one that is trying to purposely   get into the spam folder of another   account. This is so that I can ensure   that my Gmail filters are setup   correctly.   ... and a subject line such as:   Test Spam Message 1   I always incremented the number at the end of the subject for each message I sent. This way it doesn't look like a duplicate to Gmail and is actually delivered.  Next, on the receiving account, I decided to go ahead and mark the message as spam. I read in the help that it mentions that marking a message as spam is reversible. They even give an example of how a user might accidentally mark a message as spam, then undo it. This is exactly what I am hoping to emulate.  After marking the first message as spam, all the others (which contain the exact same body and only differ in the subject by one letter) are sent to spam as well.  Once I was done with the testing, I marked all the messages as non-spam. Hopefully Gmail treats this as a user accidentally marking a message as spam and doesn't resort to blacklisting the address or doing something worse.  Update: After trying this again, I had to mark a message as spam twice before anything started happening, and then I noticed weird behaviors on the account that was sending the "spam". The account was automatically logged off, and I couldn't log back in for a while. This might be an automated measure Gmail takes when users report other Gmail users as spammers.

   Logically if you repeatedly send emails that gmail interprets as spam then your email account will become a candidate for going on a blacklist.  So I would start out with a throwaway test email rather than one you might want to use again.  Secondly the easiest way to simulate spam is to farm the farmers.  Why not just put the test email account as a plain link on your homepage - you can then guarantee that spam will be targeting that account within a few hours.

   This will only help you if you can do a bit of programming:   set up an SMTP client (e.g. if you are on Windows, install IIS and SMTP support)  write a program in your favorite programming language that will send the email message and have it use your local SMTP server  use a random, invalid email for "from"  put "viagra" in subject and body for good measure   I would think that would do it.

How do I add a caption to an image in Google Documents?
</question>
<answer>
   As of October 25, 2013, Google Documents does not support text wrapping around tables, so inserting a table and putting an image and a caption in it will work but cannot be made to have text wrapped around it.  One workaround is that since text can wrap around images, we can choose Insert &gt; Drawing... and create a drawing with the text we want to caption the image with.  The resulting drawing can be changed to have text wrapped around it, and can then be placed beneath the image we inserted.      
</answer>
<answer>
    Choose Menu -&gt; Insert -&gt; Drawing.  Drag/Drop, Ctrl - V or right-click and paste in your image .  Click the "Textbox" button near the top.  Draw the textbox underneath your image, add some text.  Set the lettering font/format with the "more" button upper left.

   The accurate answer is that you cannot.  There are various methods whereby you can make the process of copying contacts from one account to another, but that requires you to copy them, and then delete them on the old account. It's not the same as a move.  Personally, for a one or two contacts, I logged into both gmail accounts at the same time, and copied and pasted the data. For more contacts, the export method suggested by Traveling Tech Guy seems to be the best option.

   This is now possible.   Whether you’re running weekend errands or planning a cross-country tour, you can plot multiple destinations for your trip with ease – now available for driving, walking and biking directions. Once you’ve chosen a starting point, click '+' and add stops to your route by typing in the search box or clicking on the map.   Source .        
</answer>
<answer>
   It is fairly simple.  What you need to do is follow steps that are mentioned below for adding multiple destinations....  From point A to Point B - add the destinations and if needed swap the destinations by dragging the "O" with either mouse+left click hold or the left button+ curser hold and moving.  Once you add the destinations hit anywhere or hit find route  or list all steps for interactive map..  Now to add destination, you can not do on the browser since there is no "+" sign there anymore once you already have activated the route. To add further, go to the map layout in the right pane and click on full map view ....  Once you click on the full map view, the route option with  a "+" will come again in the map browser window. Add the destination and hit list all steps . There you go...  Thanks and enjoy.      
</answer>
<answer>
   Just click and hold the letter label, starting destination A , click the actual A and hold and drag to where you want it in the list of stops. It's slow to move, so be patient!      
</answer>
<answer>
   Or after you have added your starting and end point instead of using the "Car" as your method of travel, switch it to "Walking" and the plus sign shows up, put in all your destination, rearrange them whatever you need to do, then switch it back to Car and now you have all your stop points with actual addresses and estimated travel time.  Works for me like a charm, just had to do it today.      
</answer>
<answer>
    Simply start out by getting directions from your departure point to your first destination.   Click the + beneath your travel points, then enter your third destination.   You can continue for as many destinations as you need, up to 10 maximum .     Another nice feature is if you get some of your steps out of order, you can drag the circle to the left of the destination in the list up our down to get it in the right spot.  Here's a link to a set of directions using your sample cities: Birmingham → Peterborough → London  (This assumes that your country has the latest version of Google Maps and that they have enough data in your country to support this. You'll also need a modern browser. I used Chrome to create these screen shots.)  Note also that this only seems to work for driving, walking, and biking directions. It doesn't work for flights or mass transit.

   If your files are of a very sensitive nature then you should already be taking measures to secure them regardless of any promises or the good reputation of the service.  If however these files are of 'normal' sensitivity then the risk of bad press will usually be enough to guarantee they're good behaviour, after all your files are probably worth less to them than your (even potential) subscription fees.

   There is no way you can tell if the companies can get access to your files, and given that they could probably bypass your password for login - it's likely that they could get to your files if they really wanted to.  The only way to be 100% sure that you alone have access to your files is to encrypt them or host the service yourself. In the latter case, you should be aware that any large company is probably going to be able to do backup and security better than you.  Finally - A company like dropbox has better things to do than to go through your files. I would suggest that for larger / more well known companies, your files will probably be safe. Firstly because their businesses rely on you trusting them and secondly, because you're just one account in a myriad of accounts.

   Not sure about Dropbox. But from the Wuala service I am using, this is what they claim:   Wuala protects your privacy: In stark contrast to most other online   storage services, all your files get encrypted on your computer, so   that no one - including the employees at Wuala and LaCie - can access   your private files. Your password never leaves your computer.  Wuala employs the 128 bit AES, 2048 bit RSA and SHA-256 algorithms for   encryption, signatures and integrity checks. If you're interested in   how Wuala manages encryption, have a look at our publication on   Cryptree.   Convincing enough for me.

   Actually, in Google Docs you can have it automatically replace the two dashes with the em dash while you type!  Menu:  Tools, preferences...  In 'Replace' type: -- In 'With':   Enter the em dash character as 'OnenOnlyWalter' suggests for keyboard shortcuts.
