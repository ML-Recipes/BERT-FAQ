1. Description

FAQ retrieval is an interesting area at the intersection of question answering,
semantic search and information retrieval. We provide here a data set for the
FAQ retrieval task in English language.
The construction of the dataset is described in:

   Mladen Karan and Jan Å najder (2015). FAQIR -- a Frequently Asked Questions Retrieval Test Collection. Proceedings of the 10th edition 
   of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC2016). In press.

2. Data set

The data set contains 4133 FAQ-pairs and 1233 queries. It is organised
into an xml file as follows:

Beneath the upper most "IRSet" tag there are three tags grouping the 
most important parts of the data set, namely the queries, documents and
relevance judgements:

1. <queries>
   Contains a list of queries in <Query> tags containing the following information:
   <Author> - the author of the query
   <infneed> - the query template on which the query is based
   <Original> - the original query from which the query template was devised
   <exWords> - list of important words in the query (these were not used 
               for the paper) 
   <QueryGroupID> - id for the query template
   <QueryID> - id for the query
   <QueryString> - text of the query 
   + some other tags which can be ignored *

2. <Pairs>
   Contains a list of FAQ-pairs in <qapair> tags containing the following information:
   <Id> - id of the FAQ pair
   <Question> - question text of the FAQ-pair
   <Answer> - answer text of the FAQ-pair
   <Categories> - list of categories into which the FAQ-pair was submitted
   + some other tags which can be ignored *
   
3. <relCandidates> - a list of relevance judgements
   This tag contains for each of the 50 query templates an <IRCandidateList> tag
   which represents an annotated list of FAQ-pair candidates that were pooled for
   that query template. An <IRCandidateList> tag contains.

   <grpId> - query template id (corresponding to <QueryGroupID> above)
   several <IRCandidate> tags (one for each pooled document) containing
   a FAQ-pair id (<Id> tag) and a list of annotations for that document
   (<Annotations> tag). Individual Annotations further contain data on the 
   time (<AnnotationTime> tag), annotator (<Annotator> tag) and value
   (<Val> tag) of the annotation. The value coding is:
    1 - relevant 
    2 - useful
    3 - useless 
    4 - irrelevant

Each query has at least one FAQ-pair annotated as "relevant".  However, it is
possible for a FAQ-pair to be irrelevant for all queries. 
 
* extra tags are there because the xml file was generate through C# object serialization
  There should be no problem reading it in any environment. Moreover, you can mail the 
  authors to obtain a C# class that will load the file and provide an interface to the data.
